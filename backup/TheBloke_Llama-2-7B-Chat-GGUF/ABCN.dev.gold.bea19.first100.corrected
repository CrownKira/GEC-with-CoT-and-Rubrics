It 's difficult to answer the question ' what are you going to do in the future ? ' if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman , and even a butcher ... I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology so that one day I can open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider it more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car when traveling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to take the bus to go to school and back home .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . In that moment , you realize the importance of a public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , including cycle , bike , car , train , and flight .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired destination , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
Travelling by car is much more fun generally speaking , compared to other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I recently went to , and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels for eating food and just in case any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait at any time when we travel by car , which is impossible when traveling by train or flight .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family thinks that my cook is amazing .
I hope you give me the chance to join you .
Thanks
My favorite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere , when I travel to the beach I like playing with my sister in the sand and afterward we go to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I liked playing with the ball in the playground and my friends and I played using the soccer goals as a net for volleyball .
Dear Joe ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that some advice on traveling and working in my country .
On the other hand , in my country there are plenty of places to travel .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Seville , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are lots of things to visit , for example , in Madrid , you can visit ' Puerta del Sol ' and ' Las Cibeles ' .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
Visiting Seville all summer is something I enjoy , and I recommend that you visit Seville too .
On the other hand , in my country there are few jobs due to a poor economy .
But if you want , I will look for a job for you .
My best friend is looking for people responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is six years old and you should look after her every weekend .
You will be interested in this job ?
Thank you for your email , it was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today public transport continues to play an important role in the transportation system and will continue to do so in the future .
Because public transport is a cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transportation system .
People do not have to suffer from high operating costs when running their own cars .
But it can be a cheaper way to go to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
Travelling to another country by private airplane is not affordable for an ordinary person .
It will be more common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
In my opinion , I think that public transport in the future will continue to be used because there are many people who do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used . So , public transport will continue to have a future , but people will use more cars than buses or underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them as we are waiting for the bus or underground , but in another way , cars cost more money than public transport .
By car , we can just stay with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like , and we do n't need to be around people who are unknown . However , if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both transportations are good , and cars do n't necessarily need to end up with public transport .
If I had to choose between both transportation , I would probably choose car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in environmental and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building , we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into organic , paper , cardboard , cans , and pet bottles . They also made talks and presentations about earth problems such as global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of this project is Miss June Smith , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us a recognized ecological community over the years .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share with you about my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , why I chose it ? Well , football is an international sport , people around the world will love it so much ! Examples include the Barclays Premier League , La Liga Premier , FIFA World Cup , and so on .
I believe that all will delight us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant , they have an amazing football player , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that he wanted to be a superhero .
After many years , he still dreams of becoming a superhero .
He entered the university of medicine because he thought it was the most similar to being a superhero .
After spending several years at university , he met a girl named Kate and fell in love with her .
Kate cursed the University of Fashion .
Then they started dating .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day when Michael said to him , ' My dream is to be a superhero . ' Kate got nervous and said it was ridiculous and just a kid 's dream . She told Michael that superheroes do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and became mad , saying that she was lying and did n't have a heart .
He became angry and asked her to leave his apartment .
In the following day , she said sorry and they were happy again .
When they reached Michael 's home , they fought again , and Michael retrieved a knife and killed her .
He cried with a lot of blood around .
Michael got away from there .
Michael closed the door and realized at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history , bringing numerous benefits to our lives .
For example , we take the subway to avoid stucking in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future and our offspring .
Giving them a safe , clean , and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic will be more severe than before .
In my country , Taipei , we always stock up in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine if there are no buses or MRTs , how long it would take me to get to school .
Cars are convenient for humans , but they bring damage to humans as well .
For example , carbon dioxide , which is created by cars .
It causes global warming , which threatens our environment and harms our daily lives .
We can see that there have been many severe and frequent weather disasters in recent decades , including typhoons , hurricanes , wildfires , and mudslides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NGO Office is notified by the photographer when the film was shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it will immediately .
Lost shipments can be found more easily once this process is started immediately .
The pleasure of travelling
People go , people come .
Every day , lots of people travel abroad , but what 's the best way to do international travel ?
The most important option for travel is , by far , the plane .
