It 's difficult to answer the question " What are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman , and even a butcher ... I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would like to open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it more easily .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
Rich people will buy cars , but poor people always need to use buses or taxis .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when travelling by bus .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to be friends and exchange telephone numbers .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to take the bus to go to school and return to my house .
In my opinion , a car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street ; at that moment , you realize the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , such as bicycles , motorcycles , cars , trains , and flights .
Depending on the distance and duration of travel to the desired place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , traveling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a recent trip I took to Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by the National Highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We stopped at hotels to have food and , just in case any of us felt hungry , we purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want when we travel by car , which is impossible when travelling by train or flight .
In addition to that , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up refreshed .
Due to the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .

In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family thinks that my cooking is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you .
Thanks .
My favorite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere . When I travel to the beach , I like playing with my sister in the sand , and afterwards , we go to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I liked playing with the ball in the playground , and my friend and I used the soccer goals as a volleyball net .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that I have some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel to .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , and Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit ; for example , in Madrid , you can visit " Puerta del Sol " and " Las Cibeles " .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visited Seville because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Seville .
On the other hand , in my country there are few jobs because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want , I can look for a job for you .
My best friend is looking for a person responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after her every weekend .
Are you interested in this job ?
Thank you for your email , it was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transportation system and it will continue to do so in the future .
Because public transport is a cost - effective and better resource for allocation in the mass transport system .
Also , people need not suffer high operating costs running their own car .
But they can use a cheaper way to go to their destination , especially if it is far from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for travelling to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
In my opinion , I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people who do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used , so public transport will continue to have a future , but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for it as we do for the bus or the underground , but on the other hand , a car costs more money than public transport .
By car , we can just stay by ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unknown . But if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both forms of transportation are good , and cars do n't necessarily need to end public transport .
If I had to choose between both modes of transportation , I think I would probably choose a car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in environmental and ecological matters .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste from the school .
In some strategic points of the building , we have special trash cans to separate the garbage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans , and PET bottles , and we also hold talks and presentations about Earth 's problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us a recognized ecological community over the years .
Good morning , everyone . Today , I want to share about my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football . Why did I choose it ? Well , football is an international sport that people around the world love so much ! Examples include the Barclays Premier League , La Liga , the FIFA World Cup , and so on .
I believe that will delight us all .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant , they have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream : to be a superhero !
After many years , he still dreams of becoming a superhero .
He entered the university of medicine because he thought that this profession was the most similar to being a superhero .
After spending some years at the university , he met a girl named Kate and he fell in love with her , and she fell in love with him .
Kate was cursing the university of fashion .
Then the two started dating .
Michael and Kate were so happy until one day when Michael told her about his dream to be a superhero . Kate got so nervous , saying that it was ridiculous and just a childish dream , and that Michael was only dreaming , but that it would never happen and that superheroes do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and got mad , saying that she was lying and did n't have a heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
The following day , she said sorry and they were happy again .
But when they got to the home of Michael , they fought again and Michael got a knife and killed her .
He cried with a lot of blood around .
Michael , get away from there .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history ; it brings a number of benefits to our lives .
For instance , we take the subway in order to avoid getting stuck in traffic .
It is true that traveling by car is more convenient than taking public transportation , however , it can cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offspring .
Give them a safe , clean , and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be more serious than before .
In my country , Taipei , we always get stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine how long it would take me to get to school if there were no buses or MRT .
A car is convenient for humans , but it also brings damage to them .
For example , carbon dioxide , which is created by cars .
It causes global warming , which threatens our environment and harms our daily life .
We can see that there have been many serious and frequent weather disasters in recent decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wildfires , and mudslides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it will be immediate .
Lost shipments are found more easily when this process is started right away .
The pleasure of traveling .
People go , people come .
Every day , lots of people travel abroad , but what is the best way to do international travel ?
The most important option for travel is , by far , the plane .
