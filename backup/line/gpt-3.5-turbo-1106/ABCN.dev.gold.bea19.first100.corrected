It 's difficult to answer the question ' What are you going to do in the future ? ' if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman , and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I will open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it more easily .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider it more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who will usually ask you to be friends and exchange telephone numbers .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and return to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . In that moment , you realize the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , such as cycles , bikes , cars , trains , and flights .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , traveling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I recently took , and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours to go from Delhi to Agra via the National Highway .
We stopped at hotels to have food , and just in case any of us feels hungry , we purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want when we travel by car ( which is impossible when traveling by train or flight ) .
In addition , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that traveling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I have organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family thinks that my cook is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you .
Thanks .
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere . When I travel to the beach , I like to play with my sister in the sand , and afterwards we go to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I liked playing with the ball in the playground , and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a volleyball net .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that I have some advice on traveling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Seville , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Madrid , you can visit the Puerta del Sol and Las Cibeles .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
Every summer I visit Seville because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Seville .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad .
But if you want me to look for a job for you .
My best friend is looking for people responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after her every weekend .
Will you be interested in this job ?
Thank you for your email . It was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and will continue to do so in the future .
Because public transport is a cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
Also , people need not suffer from high operating costs when running their own car .
But they can use a cheaper way to go to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane and travel to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
In my opinion , I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people who do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used . So , public transport will continue to have a future , but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for it as we wait for the bus or underground , but in another way , the car costs more money than public transport .
By car , we can just stay with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around unknown people . But if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both transportation options are good and the cars do n't necessarily need to compete with public transport .
If I had to choose between both modes of transportation , I think I would probably choose the car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological matters .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
At some strategic points of the building , we have special trash cans to separate the garbage into organic waste , paper and cardboard , cans , and pet bottles . They also hold talks and presentations about environmental issues such as global warming and contamination .
The manager of this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us a recognized ecological community over the years .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share about my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football . Why do I choose it ? Well , football is an international sport that people around the world love so much ! For example , the Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , FIFA World Cup , and so on .
I believe that 's all will delight us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant , they have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was to be a superhero !
After many years he still dreams of becoming a superhero .
He entered the university of medicine because he thought that this profession was the most similar to being a superhero .
After spending some years at the university , he met a girl named Kate and he fell in love with her , and she fell in love with him .
Kate was cursing the University of Fashion .
Then the two started dating .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day when Michael said he dreamed of being a superhero . Kate got so nervous , saying that it was ridiculous and just a childhood dream , and that Michael was only dreaming , but that would never happen and that superheroes do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad , saying that she was lying and does n't have a heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
The following day , she said sorry and then they were happy again .
But when they get to Michael 's home , they fight again and Michael gets a knife and kills her .
He cried with a lot of blood around .
Michael , get away from there .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings a multitude of benefits to our lives .
For instance , we take the subway in order to avoid getting stuck in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation ; however , it would cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offspring .
Giving them a safe , clean , and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be more serious than before .
In my country , Taipei , we are always stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine if there were no bus or MRT , how long it would take me to get to school .
Cars are convenient for humans , but they also bring damage to humans .
For example , carbon dioxide is created by cars .
It causes global warming , which threatens our environment and harms our daily life .
We can see that there have been lots of serious and frequent weather disasters happening in decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wildfires , and mudslides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it is immediately .
Lost shipments are found more easily when this process is started right away .
The pleasure of traveling .
People go , people come .
Every day , lots of people travel abroad , but what 's the best way to do international travel ?
The most important option for travel is , by far , the plane .
