["It 's difficult answer at the question \" what are you going to do in the future ? \" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .\nWhen I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n't know why .\nI would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .\nIt 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .\nMaybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .\nI think that the public transport will always be in the future .\nThe rich people will buy a car but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .\nI consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .\nAlso , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your telephone number .\nIn my experience when I did n't have a car I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .\nIn my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you realized the importance of a public transport .\nIn India we have various types of Public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Car , Train & Flight .\nDepending on the distance and duration to the desired place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .\nBut Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .\nThis reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .\nIt takes around 6 hours by National highway to go from Delhi to Agra .\nWe have stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .\nSince , we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & Flight ) .\nIn addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .\nDue to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .\nMy name is Sarah .\nI am 17 years old .\nI am looking forward to join you in this year summer camps .\nI love children , and I enjoy looking after them . also , I organized many sports activities before in my school .\nIn addition to that , i enjoy cooking .\nMy family think that my cook is amazing .\nI hope that you give my the chance to join you .", "Thanks\nMy favourite sport is volleyball because I love plays with my friends .\nVolleyball is a sport play every place , when I travel on the beach I like plays with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .\nIt is very funny .\nwhen I was young I like plays with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .\nDear Jo ,\nHow are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country .\nOn the one hand , in my country there are a lot of place to travel .\nFor example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .\nThere are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit for example in Madrid you can visit \" Puerta del Sol \" , \" Las Cibeles \" .\nI visit Madrid twice a year .\nAll summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .\nOn the other hand , in my country there are a few job because the economy is very bad .", "But , if you want I look for a job from you .\nMy best friend looking for a people responsible for look after her sister .\nHer sister is 6 years old and you should look after every weekend .\nYou will be interesting in this job ?\nThank you for you e - mail , it was wonderful to hear from you .\nI 'm looking forward to seeing you .\nTake care , Laura .\nToday public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .\nBecause public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .\nAlso people need not to suffer high operating cost running their own car .\nBut it can use a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is far away from home .\nFor example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .\nInstead it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on public plane .\nIn my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .\nIf we think about it the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them has we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way car cust more money than the public transport .\nBy car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport .\nIf I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably chose car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .\nIn my community , we are very interested at environment and ecological things .\nWe have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .\nIn some strategic points of the building we have special trashcans to separate the garbage in organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles and they also made talks and presentations about the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc .\nThe manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .\nAll this initiatives has made us all over the years a recognised ecological community .\nGood morning everyone , today I want to share about is my favorite sport .\nMy favorite sport is football , why I choose it?Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .\nI believe that 's all will delighted us .", "By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United , they are brilliant , they have an amazing football players , and they are awesome .\nMichael was a little kid when he had a dream that was : Be a super hero !\nAfter many years he still dream to become a

dream to be a super hero , Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero do n't exist .\nWhen she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad saying that she was lying and do n't have heart .\nHe got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .\nIn following day , she said sorry and them was happy again .\nBut when them get to the home of Michael they fight again and Michael get a knife and kill her .\nHe cried with a lot blood around .\nMichael get away from there .", "Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .\nPublic transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings amount of benefits in our life .\nFor instance , we take subway in order to avoid stocking in traffic .\nIt is true that moving by car is more convenient than take public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our life and harm our environment .\nTherefore , we need to think more about our future , our offsprings .\nGiving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .\nIf there is no public transportation , traffic jam will be serious than before .\nIn my country , taipei , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .\nI can not imagine if there is no bus or MRT , how long I will take for school .\nCar is convenient for human , but it brings damage for human also .\nFor example , carbon dioxide which is created by car .\nIt cause global warming which threats our environment and harms our daily life .\nwe can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades , such as typhoon , hurricane , wild fire and mud slide .\nWhat other precautions , is
