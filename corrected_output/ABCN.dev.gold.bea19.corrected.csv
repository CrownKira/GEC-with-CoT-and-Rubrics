4,"But , if you want , I will look for a job for you .
My best friend is looking for people responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you would have to look after her every weekend .
Would you be interested in this job ?
Thank you for your e - mail . It was wonderful to hear from you .
I ' m looking forward to seeing you ."

My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport that is played everywhere . When I am on the beach I like playing with my sister in the sand and then we go in the sea .
It is great fun .
When I was young I liked playing with a ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a volleyball net .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I ' m writing to give you some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Madrid you can visit "" Puerta del Sol "" , "" Las Cibeles "" .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
Every summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are few jobs because the economy is very bad ."
1,"It 's difficult to answer the question "" what are you going to do in the future ? "" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology , because one day I would like to open my own psychology clinic and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it more easily .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always exist in the future .
Rich people will buy a car , but poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider it more convenient to drive a car , because you carry more things in your own car than when travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you to be friends and exchange telephone numbers .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , a car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . At that moment , you realize the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , like , bikes , cars , trains & planes .
Depending on the distance and time to the desired destination , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been on and the place I visited was Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We stopped at hotels to have food and just in case any of us felt hungry , we purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
For the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah ."
5,"Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on doing so in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in a mass transport system .
Also , people need not suffer the high operating cost of running their own car .
But can use a cheaper way of going to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for travelling to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and travel on a public plane .
In my opinion , public transport is going to continue to be used in the future because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used , so public transport will continue to have a future but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for it like we wait for the bus or underground , but on the other hand , cars cost more money than public transport .
In a car , we can just be by ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unknown , but if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both modes of transport are good , and cars do n't need necessarily to bring an end to public transport .
If I had to choose between both forms of transportation , I think I would probably choose the car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the garden , with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
At some strategic points in the building , we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and plastic bottles and they also give talks and presentations about the earth 's problems , like global warming , pollution , etc .
The manager of this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us all , over the years , a recognised ecological community .
Good morning everyone . Today I want to share about my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football . Why do I choose it ? Well , football is an international sport . People around the world love it so much ! Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .
I believe that everything will delight us ."
6,"By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant . They have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was : to be a super hero !
After many years , he still dreamt of becoming a super hero .
He went to university to study medicine because he thought that that profession was the most similar to being a super hero .
After some years at university he met a girl called Kate and he fell in love with her and she fell in love with him .
Kate was attending university to study fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day Michael told her about his dream of being a super hero . Kate got so agitated , saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid 's dream and that Michael was only dreaming and that would never happen and that super heroes did n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and got mad , saying that she was lying and did n't have a heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
The following day , she said sorry and they were happy again .
But when them got to the home of Michael , they fought again and Michael got a knife and killed her .
He cried with a lot of blood around .
Michael got away from there ."
9,"The pleasure of travelling is not travelling at all .
Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many of kinds of transportation . Now we travel by car , but in the near future there will be other comfortable and easy ways to travel , like fast trains and planes that can transport you from north to south in less than an hour . This will make businessmen happy and comfortable , because of saving a lot of time and effort , so we hope that the government can achieve this as soon as possible .
In modern societies , there are lots of friends in our daily lives ."
8,"People go , people come .
Every day , lots of people are travelling abroad , but what 's the best way to do international travel ?
The most important option to travel is , by far , the plane .
But , even if it 's true that it 's the fastest option , you must be very careful when it 's time to get off a plane .
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy on the trip .
However , the best option is to choose a train .
There is n't a comparison between watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go ."
11,"I went to the abandoned house and started to think of the best way to make his life miserable . I spent the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him suffer .
As I did n't find anything , I went to the place where he lived and started to look for some information about his life and find people who he cared about . So as I continued to go to his house , I noticed he would always go to the same house , s I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a girl . She might be his girlfriend , so I finally got an idea . I would drive him crazy just as he did me . That way she would think he had problems with his mind and leave him . But soon i thought about it again and realized that if I did that she would try to help him and they will be more united , so I decided to drive them both crazy , almost to the brink of death , just as he did with me !
But wait a minute , am I really sufficiently angry to do this ?"
10,"Big projects could not be finished without cooperation .
Friends can communicate and exchange ideas , feelings and funny things that happen around us .
More importantly , parents give us life and they teach us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this case , family members play important roles in our daily lives .
The reasons are as follows .
First of all , we can learn lots of skills from parents based on their own experience .
For example , we can learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we can also learn how to make a meal from parents .
Secondly , family members can give you some advice about how to deal with the things which cause you trouble .
If difficulties are shared with family members , ideas will come up to your family members and they will communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
All in all , in this case , family members are the most important friends in our lives .
Computing Technology has been advancing a great deal in recent years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better , and making the difference between old and new computers grow even more with every new invention .
As we can see , old and new computers are vastly different , starting from the size of the computers . Old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Old computers used to occupy one entire room , now , they are only the size of a box , even the size of a book .
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place you visit .
Old computers only let you do math tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing video games , writing or reading a book , connect to the internet , watch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve Computing Technology , and not only in 2 colors , but thousands of them .
One of the greatest achievements of new computing is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc . via Ethernet cable or Wireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .

7,"Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings a tremendous amount of benefits to our lives .
For instance , we take the subway in order to avoid being stuck in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offspring .
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be more serious than before .
In my city , Taipei , we are always stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine how long I would take to get to school if there was no bus or MRT .
The car is convenient for humans , but it brings damage for humans too .
For example , carbon dioxide , which is emitted by cars .
It causes global warming , which threatens our environment and harms our daily life .
We can see that there are lots of serious and frequent weather - related disasters happening in recent decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wild fires and mud slides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?

12,"Yes !
I screamed . My anger had dominated my mind . I did n't have no longer control over my actions . I was afarid of what I had become and what I could do , but I could not control my self and the only thing I could think of was him suffering a slow death and the pain I would feel when I finally had my revange , the best revange .
But I was so mad at him and so angry at myself for trying to make his life imposible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering I had been doing became stronger and bigger . I had made a decision . I was going to do it . If he dedicated 4 years of his life to following me and not wanting me to be happy , I would think it was nesesary for him to have a miserable life and I wo n't stop until I had acomplished my goal .

Public transportation has been used by people more and over the years it has been kind of becoming cheaper and also safer , but some people prefer cars . To what extent do we agree with this and what are our reasons for that ? That is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay .
before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there was not even a good facility to move from place to place and that is because there were no companies to build cars . In about 10 years cars became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans . At the beginning , the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve them by the end .
Nowadays , all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses , even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they do like crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places .
To summaries , it is different from some one opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more , that by the end cars will disappear and will no longer be used
The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in the picture , scenario has changed in the past 10 years
Development of the biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth .

Meanwhile , it boosts economic growth and jobs opportunity , thereby enhancing Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
If you are living in a big town or small town , it does matter , but one thing should be taken care of by the people and organiser of the town , is the environment .
Global warming is a huge issue at today 's date .
Government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However , we the people have a really important part of making it worse .
Active and good governments understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
Recycling items can be a good step to start with a clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city .
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home according to a rule of the provincial government .
People are not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere .
Eventually , humans will have no more fresh air to breath .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and under 18 years old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment in the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbour cities to take part in cleaning the environment so one day it can be seen in the whole country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football .
On our school or villiage football stadium , I spend a lot of time every day playing football .
Usually I play football with my classmates .
Before training , I ran 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs got a power and my body got an energy .
Our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us on how to improve football skills .
His main words : "" You must work and work very hard , if you want to get high results "" .
I can say that the coach is an experienced person .
Not so long ago , we had competition .
The first place was won by us .
We achieved this result because we are friendly and organised .
I believe , that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Skhatar or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport : "" You must believe in yourself "" .

In my opinion , public transport wo n't suffer from a shortage of demand .
Because not everyone can afford to buy their own car .
Besides , there are lots of low income people who ca n't buy their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What does "" Family "" mean ?
In my opinion , Family is the place that you and your best friend can help each other and know each other .
In Taiwan , many people have to take care of their parents when they get old , but the point is , what if you can not survive ? I mean , you do n't have enough money to look after your parent .
Back to the topic . I do n't know any of the members of my family well . I do n't trust them , to be honest .
I like New Zealand because there are many islands .

I live in Lentini , a small city in East Sicily .

People collect any kind of rubbish and throw it all together in black sacks .
Although the council began to plan something , the people are n't committed to the problem .

We always played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laughed a lot of ...
But when I was a teenager , I began to experience situations that I did not like , for instance , girls said bad things to me or they talked unkindly about me .
In those years , I went through the worst moments of my life .
I remember , when I celebrated my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party . I think that that day was one of the worst days of my life .
That night , I cried because I felt that I did n't have any friends .
However , my parents tried to make it so that my party was the best and they prepared a special birthday for me and they invited all my cousins and we together we went to eat pizza and they gave me a lot of presents .
At that moment , I thought that my best friends were my parents and sister .
I knew that they never talked bad about me .
Now , my husband is my best friend .
He is the most important person in my life .
He has always been with me .
Also , he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him .
We both like to travel around the world and to do some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekking .
We like watching TV series and cooking different desserts , too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially David , my husband .
The lives of people around the globe are becoming busier and busier day by day .
A busy life always compells to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made the public transportation system lag behind motor cars .

In conclusion , it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel for better education prospects and a stable environment for younger generations to grow up .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs . Economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of brain - drain should be tackled at international and national levels on a broader dimensions and more rational pattern , because it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting the infrastructure and law enforcement to support the public in a positive way .

My favourite sport is running .
I like running fast , so fast in fact that it feels as if I run on air and the feet do not hardly touch the ground between the strides .
My favourite place to run is in the forest , but I like to run sportively too .
I like to feel the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city streets .
The best advice I can give to someone who is starting running is to start slowly and not to try to run too fast , but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little further and a little faster and then , after 20 years , you will be an Olympic champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the news or a show about World War One ."

No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travelling , so it has a future .
Currently , most people are used to using their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to it being more comfortable .
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject , they would n't use their own car so much .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all , you need to be able to afford to buy it . After that , you must pay for the insurance , road tax , and mechanic 's bills , and so on .
On the other hand , with public transport , you only have to pay for the ticket , you do n't have to drive , and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use breaks down , it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollutes less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has a future , and the more people use it , the more future it will have .

Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Here is one question : do television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience , I believe television has both entertainment and educational functions .
It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learns different basics from a great number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
It also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart from educational content , there is so much bad content , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .
However , I believe educational programmes on TV still play a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think the best restaurant we can go to is "" The Sailor 's Restaurant "" .
There we can eat typical Italian food .
The last time I was there I ate the best pizza that I have ever eaten in my life .

Also , it 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space , so we can sit all together at the same table ."
29,"Very pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
But the pay is a little low .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring three students , completing summer homework , correcting homework , diligently assisting the instructor , helped the instructor organize handouts , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also cleaning the classroom , very hard work , but I have nothing to complain about .
I work hard for two months , pay a lot .
It 's just that your wage paid is much lower than I expected . I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yuan more than the existing wage basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think that the government should help the public transport , for example buses , trains , the metro and more , for a single reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying to search for parking spaces and because of the cost of fuel , and also maintenance costs .
In big cities , public transport works well because there 's good feedback from people .
Conversely , in small towns , it ca n't be good in the same way , because , for the transport companies , it 's not convenient to invest money in transport , because fewer people would use it .
Tom Sawyer was a boy that lived with his aunt Polly and she had to punish Tom , because sometimes Tom did n't go to school .
On Monday , Tom was walking to school and he saw his friend Huck and they talked a lot and Tom exchanged a tick for his tooth .
Then he saw a beautiful girl named Becky , so Tom talked to her at school and they went into a secret garden and Tom kissed Becky .
Tom said to her about another girl , so she got mad and she ignored Tom .
Tom was so sad because Becky did n't to talk to him , so Tom went on a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks .
When Tom saw his house , he sneaked into his house and saw his aunt Polly crying for him .
So the next day , the people of the town went to church to attend the funeral of Tom , because many people thought that Tom was dead . But suddenly Tom opened the door and went in , so everybody was so surprised to see Tom .
The next day , Huck went to Tom 's house to tell him that there was an abandoned house up the hill , so the two boys considered like an adventure .
So they went to the mysterious house and when they were inside they heard voices , so Tom and Huck hid and they saw that Injuin Joe was the one that was talking .
The two boys heard that he was planning to steal some money and kill people , so the boys started their adventure with stopping Injuin Joe ...

31,"I will do my best to answer your questions .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in a Japanese restaurant , such as "" ryotei "" and "" izakaya "" .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skills in them .
Recently , many south East Asians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
By improving their Japanese skills in Japan , they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Sarah 's house when suddenly he left the bathroom dirty and went to his house .
So he went back to Sarah 's house and cleaned the whole bathroom , but Sarah already knew that he had left the bathroom like that , so before Michael entered the bathroom she said : "" I know what you left there "" and Michael went running to the bathroom .

My school has a unique reputation for its friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my maths teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand .
Good Morning :
This is an esay about my favourite sport . It has been swimming since I was a child , because I always enjoy it a lot and , what is more , I can do it alone . I never miss a chance to go the to swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like swimming . Most like football or similar team sports , so I always go alone . It is n't boring for me . Furthermore , I prefer going alone because nobody bothers me and I do n't have to wait for anybody .
I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had an operation on her back and , before the operation , he came with me and , every day , I had to wait for her because she spent a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hair . I hated that !
Luckily , the operation was fine and she stopped coming with me , and since that day , I go on my own .
Swimming is relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool . But sometimes there are children and I do n't like that so much because they like disturbing me . But sometimes it is amusing , too .
I would recommended people who do not know to how swim to learn , because I am pretty sure that they will like it and later they can stop swimming .
I think that dance is a means of self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby ; it 's more than that .
Dance is a passion , a way of life .
When I ' m dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupid companions that do n't understand anything .
But this is another theme for speaking .
When you dance , sing , or act , you are showing something to the public , something that 's important to you .
If dance is your passion , you practise every day , and you 'll keep practising all day until you can .
If you are tired , it does n't matter , because you like what you 're doing .
You 'll wake up early to go dancing , or take dance classes .
You do n't mind if you go to sleep late , or do n't sleep ...
That 's a joke . You must sleep .
If you love dance , you 'll understand me .
Members of my family .
I love my family , especially my little sister . She is sixteen years old . I consider her my best friend because I usually tell her everything about my life .
I have a dog and its name 's Chente . It is a golden retriever .
It 's a lovely dog . He knows how I feel .
My oldest sister , whose name is Cinthya , is really weird towards me .
Our relationship is not good because she is so different to me .
Also , I have a brother whose name is Jose Luis . He is twenty years old , his personality is dynamic and funny .
My mom and my dad are good people .
Actually , I prefer spending my time alone . I am working in another town , so I live away from my family .
Dear mrs .
Kate Ashby ,
How are you ? I hope you are well .
To work in our cafe you have to speak English , of course , maybe know how to cook some types of sweet foods like cupcakes , cakes , cookies or brownies , the most popular foods of this year .
Another thing that you must know is how to deal with people . We are searching for someone who can impress everyone , also someone who can give the customers good attention and service .
We need someone prepared to work long hours , because our cafe is going to open every day .
That 's all , see you soon"
35,"Good day ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Volleyball , one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 . The reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows :
1- make me fit and healthy"

We think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will be dissappearing . After that , we will be having wars .
In 30 years we will have changed our anatomy . Also , we will be eating fast food . On the other hand , the north pole will have melted completely .
The temperature will have become crazy by global warming , so some people will have died because natural disasters will be more aggressive .
Technology will have advanced and maybe the cars will be flying on the streets and computers will have totally changed .
Because of this , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and we help the planet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
How to make friends and meet new people ?
It is easier than you think .
Just ... start talking !
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calmly talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find a point between your opinion and your friend 's opinion .
Just try , it wo n't cost you much !"
36,"2- classy game , no friction between players
3- it exercises all the muscles of your body
Regarding the above , I advise all rookies to start practicing this sport and they will get many benefits .
However , the adults can practise it as well and they will get the same benefits .
As citizens of our village , we totally care about the environment of our village .
Every sunday , we do a mutual cooporation where anyone can treat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
We clean the dirty ditch , sweep rubbish , then we bury rubbish .
Whilst we recycle inorganic rubbish too .
From inorganic , we can make bags , hats and other stuffs .
Then they can sell them and get income from it .
The creator of the haven and the earth , the creator of soles , the one who makes earth rotate around it self and around the sun .
What we believe as Muslims that we have created by one who does n't have another with him is the one who created our father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Eve ) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree , but Satan deceived them , so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. who they worship the same one ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the hell . So because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .
Transportation is the heart of any city , whether it is public or private ."
40,"Travelling by bus is very stressful because people push me or I ca n't sit down because there is n't any chair for me .
On the other hand , in the future maybe we would have a bus which has a chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the taxi like a car . It is so comfortable too , but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The AVE or aeroplane are a good option for a long trip .
In conclusion , in the future we should have a bus that is so much more comfortable .

39,"Today , the topic is Technology .
Nowadays , we use technology in every thing , from education to making clothes . We use technology everyday and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development , but todays generation is so influenced by technology that they have stopped doing other activities .
Last year , my friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition . He liked the idea so he decided to enter the competition .
But there was a fee in order to enter the competition . He had no money . Fortunately , he has a lot of friends who can lend him money .
He phoned me and asked me to lend him some money to register for the competition .
He took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started writing the story . After long time spent writing and doing a good job , he went to give his story to the international student magazine office . He found out there was a notice on the door saying that the competition had canceled . He came back vey sad and told me what had happened . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the pollution on our planet ."
38,"I met many people in the park .
I never thought about it , people got so many pets .
In the peak time , the park is very busy , even though the park is huge !
Some people are very friendly , the same as their dog .
But some people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive against other dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Every member has his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , has to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
Usually there are generation problems . Sons do n't understand parents and vicecersa , but dialoging and listening to emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
Parents must give rules to sons to underline limits in social behaviour , but also must listen others point of view to - arrange and update his knowledge .
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone gives his contribution to family duties .
Recently I saw the thriller of Mokingjay part 2 .
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before you understand it .
The first movies were amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fans of this series had been wanting this movie since the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because it is hard for little kids to understand . In my opinion , it is more a teenage movie .
I think people will like this movie because , it is very similar to the story of the book ; this is one of the first movies that is really based in the book . The theme is very unique and original . Also , the actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will put double effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the las part mokingjay !
My favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I ' ve had a very bad and stressful day , I can relax doing karate , because it 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Training Karate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your tiring routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to achieve this advantage with other sports .
Apart from that , Karate is not just a sport , it is also a discipline , it teach you respect , balance and even culture .
My teacher shows us how we have to behave with others and he teach us a lot of things about the japanese culture .
For someone who starts Karate it is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
Technology is something that is very important , something without which we can not live ."
43,"But benefits after year off will be obvious .
I live in San Miguel Almoloyan . This is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the State of Mexico . The care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the care of this .

All around the world pupils are waiting for finishing school .
They are eager to begin a new life as adults .
But when they reach the in - between period , confused feelings cross their minds .
As a rule , after last exams , they do n't know what university to choose .
What they will do in future , they see , like in a fogg .
In this way , the idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
Firstly , it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard - work studying period .
Ten or eleven years at school make them tired , in spite of pupils who do n't notice it .
But choosing the second education is a very important step , which needs serious attitude .
Secondly , a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves in new professional activities .
Also , they would have an opportunity to be involved in volontier activity .
And thirdly , they might work for earning their own money or travel .
This year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting new power for future education .
One year is not a long period ."

Dear Sir Dimara .
I am writing about a problem in my city .
I live in Patras , a big city in Greece .
In my city , all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and writing .
The vandalism in Patras has increased a lot .
Unfortunately , when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls , they do not hear us .
For our city , it is very bad because when some new people visit Patras they see that thing .
Patras is a very beautiful city and for her culture , and for her monuments .
Why did you see that abaser thing ?
After we have this beautiful city , we have to maintain her .
In my opinion , the police should stop the Vandalisme .
If it has police all around the city , nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something to solve that problem ."

Technology has changed people 's lives very much . In fact , we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents ' lives . For example , my parents did n't watch TV , because there was n't any tv in the world when they were young . But it is n't the only difference : we can think at the mobile phone , the computer , or at least the internet . Our grandparents could n't imagine a strange machine like a computer in their life .
Despite the fact that personal vehicles like the car are now popular , in the future , the existence of public transport will still be absolutely crucial .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing . This source of energy does n't always maintain at a constant level , but someday it will be run out .
People must find ways to use other energy sources , such as nuclear electricity , wind power , public transportation , such as electric metros , to use this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the use of these new types of energy . Travel using public transport will become much cheaper than a personal car .
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas . It will become much more convenient .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the first choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the near future , almost cities in the world will become overcrowded . It will lead to many other problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air pollution .
In some countries , these problems are led by the over - use of personal vehicles .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time on traffic jams or to gradually kill themselves for breathing polluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is by public transport .
Each person should practice saving when using any source of energy to protect his own life .
In conclusion , investments on developing public transport will be increased considerably . Public transport has a bright potential and it 's stance in the future ca n't be replaced .

And also , can you give me an idea of how much it would cost every different option ?

Lastly , let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening to conversations with his new neighbours .
They are planning to rob a very precious thing from the Museum tonight .
He does n't have much time to prove their plan and he could not wait to let it happen .
It is his town and it is his duty too to save the town 's history .
He called the police and informed them about his neighbours robbery plan .
The police reached the Museum and caught the robbers red handed .
I am beleving that there is no future for public transport . Using trains is convenient and low expenses also to decrease the carbon dioxide which affects the ozone . People should be aware of the effect of using public transport on the environment and enviroment . Governments should encourage people to use other ways for transport . This subject shall be raised in all media to learn and encrage the people to use the other ways for transport .

In my town , we create a small organization for a more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be attractive . The citizens in the town must participate in this . The citizen will take the responsibility for a specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish in the correct place and clean the tree and plant more of it .
I ' m agreeing with the opinion that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
It is horrible to have a person following you all the time . You do not have a life , not peace , not a happy life .
In addition , all people have the right to privacy and to be free .
Nevertheless , journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they eat , drink , happy , sad . How is your love life and with whoever stays , if you stay with something important , that is what you buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privacy . The society has a blame , because if they do not take a photo , our follows the life of the famous people bored .
So that politicians and film stars will support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have the reward for what they earn ."

One day , I visited Meandro del melero .
It was beautiful .

The other day , I walked a lot and on the way , we found a waterfall .

English is an international language which becomes important in the modern world .
In China , English is taken to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
They begin to study English at an early age .
They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day .
Even children in kindergarten have begun learning simple words .
That 's a good phenomenon , because English is essential nowadays .
In addition to , some people think English is superior to Chinese .
In my opinion , though English is for great significance , but English is after all a foreign language .
It is hard for people to see eye to eye .
English does help us read English original works , but Chinese helps us learn a true China .
Only by characters , Chinese literature can send off its brilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , especial its classic culture , the first thing is learning its language .
Because we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our own culture through a foreign language ?
I was last month in a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for its big burguers .

In my opinion , the restaurant can be better , respecting meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I expect to be more famous , better and bigger .
The problem with the restaurant is the place , it is far from the people and cities , and the space is very small for lots of people .

Once upon a time there was one little ant called Penny . He was really small compared with the others .
He hated to be like that because most of the ants made fun of him until one day something horrible and inevitable happened .
It was a dark night , it was raining until a big active volcano explosion buried them in the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one could find one ... They started to get panicked !
People just started to evacuate rapidly until it began a big earthquake ...
Penny was too sad , the only thing that he could do is wait and keep calm .
Until the dawn , all of them go out , so they are sacred until they find refuge .
Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one found anything .
Like they were very religious ants they prey on her sacred ancestors , so they could help them in the big deal .
Something that they do n't know was that the whole thing was a movie !
So all was planned ...
The actors had monitors that watched ants all the time .
One day Penny discovered it and it went to tell it to his queen , the queen at knowing that she got very confused , but at the same time she got mad and she wanted revenge .
So they made a plan to display all ...
The next day when they were about to start filming , they searched for them , but they ca n't find them ...
In that moment , the ants and Penny attack them in their backs , making them to leave the place .
The ants win the war and they expand their habitat to the studio .
No one attacks them again and they live happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of them , I ' m keen on playing basketball the best . I always spend more time playing it .
I usually play basketball every day for at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at university , I go home and then I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing makes sure that I have already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketball has many benefits for me but also for everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwind ."

37,"Nowadays , people prefer their own vehicles rather than
public transportation . Day by day people are more crazy about own vehicles which leads to a dark future of public transportation .
Firstly , I agree with given statement that there would be a tough time for public transportation in near future .because people wamnt privacy as well as freedom which is quite impossible in public transportation .
Secondly , these modes of transportation cover
as much as possible of the city area or town which has a mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation . As a consequence , generally people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I can say that there are various modes of transportation avaliable
to competition with public transportation .
Nowadays , people have numerous options for travelling , like many private companies .
Which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this , consumers get more benefits like lower faire , privacy , freedom and safe travelling . In addition , many automobile companies launcing new cars with affordable prices which insiost people to use more and more private vehicles .
I go for a walk to a park every day with my lovely two Corgi dogs ."
55,"The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic about this game .
My favourite team is India because I belong to this country .
In India , 85 percent of people follow cricket .
In 1993 , the Indian cricket team won their first world cup and that changed the direction of air in favour of cricket and everyone started to follow this game .
I love this game because my favourite sportman belongs to this game .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulakar , known as a little master .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow this person .
His stance , style , shots , running between the wickets , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not only me , but also every Indian always follows Sachin for cricket .
When he was 18 , he played his first game for India .
He is the first player to play a 200 test in cricket .
He has many achievements , like first 200 in one day etc .
I love the way he was played .
For a nuance , first they have to decide what they want to do better , batting or bowling .
If a person wants to become a bowler , then concentrate on running , action , stance and for batsmen , they need concentration on lag and bat coordination , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which became a key factor in batting .
Also watch videos of some of the best players , like Sachin , Rahul , Sir Don breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaram , Brett Lee etc .
As health is an important factor in every sport , we also need to improve health , stamina .
Dear Jo ,
It 's glad to hear you are going to visit my country .
I am looking forward to this .
I can give you any advice on traveling and working in my country .
I wish you will have a good time .
The weather is neither hot nor cold all year . You need n't bring too many clothes because you can buy them here .
If you want to travel this city , I can be your guide as I have a year free before university too .
This is a modern city .
People usually go here for shopping or eating .
There are many local foods very popular .
You may like this .
I also want to introduce my friends to you . We can have fun together .
When you have played enough in this city , and you want to find a job here .
I can send you to my uncle 's company to do a job .
Because it is difficult to get a job here if you are foreign and have n't finished college .
It may take very long to find a job and you have not spent much time here .
You may consider my advice .
My favorite sport is swimming .
It 's because swimming is really fun .
Also , I think swimming can keep our bodies fit and it can make people who swim feel cool when it is a hot day .
The advice that I give to someone who wants to start swimming .
It is not to be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn to swim and also , when they become older , it will be more difficult to learn than the little .
So these are the advice that I give them ."
54,"I like playing it .
When I have spare time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball matches on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it near a sports centre .
I go back home and have a deep sleep when I finish it .
Basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's the reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming population , many agricultueal land , forest and ocesn had been destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human and animals .
To start with , there are a wide range of problems that could maybe lead to this phenomeon .
Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all modern cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people have now destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their needs , which will distory the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity , especially the endangered species .
According to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that governments should adopt to deal with this problem . First of all , reducing building constructure from now on , planting more trees instead .
Sustainability development should be awaness to all human beings and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before things get worse . Governments have to take responsibility for that .
Nowadays , languages are very important , and more English .
This is not my first time that I studied English .
I have been studying English since I was a child and I have never spoken and learned so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I made that decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity , I said yes .
The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it produces a lot of pollution , but public transport is better for a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
Nowadays , in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram etc . These options are more economical than the car . The problem with the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people .
This situation causes many pollution for the environment , so we have more conscience for the planet health .
I want to say something about the learning of the English language . It is hard to get to me for the next reasons :
First reason ; the grammar that learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like Spanish Languaje , my native language .
That I want to say , it is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just Imaging you the same but not in your native language .
Second reason . in the English syntaxis , the structure for construction paragraphs or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but not always . Which is the rule ?
Is there anyone ?"
57,"The city where I live is a small village .
All residents take great care of the environment .
Organized shares , where everyone cleans up the village .
All residents segregate garbage into suitable containers .
Thus helping to protect our environment to make it clean , safe , in order to not jeopardize our various diseases .
In my village there are trash cans , so that no one throws debris on the ground .
There are places where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power plant .
Recently , the roof of the primary school was set up with batteries and the whole school uses solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment . Residents participate in them .
The residents of my village try to , so that our village is clear of pollution that pollutes the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride on public transportation . There are several reasons to consider .
Firstly , the bus always drops by to get a passenger that takes a longer time than expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicle route is more far than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privacy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than buying a new car and for the adventurer who wants to have an exciting trip for then to see more action .
Like watching outside or sight seeing , to mingle and meet different people .
In addition to this , I also admire the bullet train in japan , which is the fastest and most safe public vehicle I ve known .
To sum it up , I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient .
Public future unless they have a project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger .
As far as I ' m concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extracting the mineral will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it would probably disappear if the developing equipment were being set .
Next to go will be , extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely lead to air pollution .
There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral .
No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important things which should be prevented .
Last but not least , mineral extraction will turn out to be a profound influence , especially , on our offspring .
To take my friend , Taylor , as an example , her homeland was over - developed and became an arid place when she was a child .
After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , she has no memory of her childhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us .
Due to mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nutshell , based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extracting the valuable mineral outweigh the advantages .
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of poor cars .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
Global warming is a serious issue . Higher temperatures make the ice caps melt .
The longer we burry our heads in the sand , the warmer the Earth will be .
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .
Even if it will happen , there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too expensive , not only for buying but for fuel , service and so forth .
Buses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .
And what about trains ?
I saw tv about trains in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see a blue sky and not a stream of cars like it was in the film "" The Fifth Element "" .

I ' m 25 years old and I ' m from Malaysia . I ' m an energetic , cheerful , hardworking and a considerable person .
I have 3 siblings in my family who are taking care of me all the time when parents are busy with their work .
During my school , I like to play volleyball and I ' m an excellent player .
We used to organise competitions and tournaments with other schools .
This is my favourite sport .
During my leisure time , I like to help my parents in the kitchen .
We cook varieties of food and dishes .
I enjoy the dirty and oily hands in the kitchen .
With reference to the above , I would like to apply for the Summer Camp job with my full commitment .

Your order for 6 air conditioning is incomplete . We apologize for the inconvenience .
We have conscience of this mistake . We had a confusion about the number of air conditioning before the telephone conversation with your secretary to confirm your purchase .
Because your order was confirmed too late and I knew that the order was n't in advance , we only could send 5 pieces .
Since the units were sold in inventory , but your purchase indicates that 6 pieces were confirmed , do not worry about it , we will send you the remaining unit as soon as possible .

63,"Hello friend ,
I know you are searching for a flat to live for the whole next year .
Maybe I found something for you : when I was on the bus returning to home , I read a journal with some advertisements .
There is a nice flat near my home : it is perfect for someone who wants to live there for only an year .
There are a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a bathroom with shower but without bath and a cool living - room .
I think that you have to bring winter clothes with you because here there is really cold weather !
Write me soon"
62,"There are many sources and creators , as well as themes .
It is well known that many Art curators and artists believe that Contemporary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based on their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the time this is unintelligible .
Luckily , the most expensive art is still the old , like Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays , a lot of empty art pieces are being sold at auctions around the world , for extraordinary high prices .
Experimental Art has taken the world of art by surprise .
Humanity has reached a level of differences that it would not be possible to stop .
So now we have many choices and an infinite amount of information available at any given time .
With this stated , we now have an idea of how artists create .
The sports days were held at Kwai Chung Sports Ground on 12th and 13th November .
That weather was partly cloudy .
I got there by MTR .
I arrived at the sports ground at 7:40 a.m. This year I ' ve joined the 100 - metre race .
On the first day before the sports day begins , we have the opening ceremony .
The athletic representative pasted the torch and we sang the hymn .
After that , the sports day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the girl 's grade C 100 metre race started .
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal .
The teacher called my name twice and he told me to stand in a different place .
So I know that there was someone whose name was the same as me .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I was running , I heard my housemates cheering and the wind passing my face .
That feeling was very comfortable and made me feel relax .
Finally , I got number 10 out of 27 people .
Although it is not a great result , I ' ve already tried my best .
At the end of the day , our school announced the mark the four houses have got .
My house got number two temporarily .
I felt hopeful and wanted my house to get the champion .
On the second day , my classmates called me to take part in the Inter - class relay race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running .
Finally , our class got the first runner up .
We have a difference of 0.5 seconds . That is the first of the races .
I implicated my class in winning the champion .
Finally , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the champion in the next year .
"" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient "" .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
We should use public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harming the environment and the world .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking or running . On the other hand , it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong with going to a place in a car . Obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper , but not always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient , but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
It is commonly - debated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspects of one country , but of the whole world .
Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorants .
First of all , tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongside its development , the ablity of travelling has increased to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country , but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important role in their growth from an economic point of view .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which tourism relies merely on tourism .
If tourism influences the environment , it thereby influnces the environment , and if it influences the environment , it influences transport . How ? People become more careful of their historcal sites , this way preserving them .Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
At a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficiently .
At a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : on land , on sea or air .
Through the development of tourism , there were cruises and train vacations .
One time there was a tiger who lived in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 daughters .
The tiger was named Amanda of 25 years old . The herders killed her parents , because the herders were poor and did n't have enough food to survive , so they killed them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion named John of 27 years old . His dad died because in a conflict with other animals , he got an infection .
His mom died because some things or someone dragged her of the leg and dropped her in a cave and other animals ate her .
They died when John was too little to remember and he never knew what had happened , so he went to all the parts for them , even he walked and walked even in reverse , but he never found them .
The 3 daughters are so different from each other .
The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah . She is 9 years old and she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and has a lot of spots .
She is one of the ones that tend to make something enforcing .
The second daughter , Elizabeth , is a leopard who is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
She is 12 years old .
Another animal gives them rewards or bonuses because she discovers that water is liquid .
The last daughter was Ana , who was the youngest of the family and was a jaguar .
She stayed sleeping in the bed and doing nothing all day .
Their parents were angry because she was the only one that never worked .
One of the animals went with Ana and gave her an incentive to be an athlete or do something else than stay sleeping .

Hello Riley , about the question you asked me in your letter . It has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up on your music classes .
You have been taking classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free time you could still play piano without going to classes .
This is my opinion , but the decision is yours , so when you decide it , please send me a letter telling me about it ."
67,"I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was on the beach all afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people on the beach .
The water was very cold and I could n't swim . Then I played football on the sand of the beach .
I sat in the sun for a very long time and then I went to a cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I spent a good time with my family .
No future for public transpotr ? is this claim true or no ?
Will we see public transport in 5 or 10 years yet ? That is really a really interesting question/
I think that it all depands from development .
Now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
Yes , I agree . If you plan on travelling for a long time and for a long time , you would prefer to do it in a car , because first , you 'll spend less time travelling , you will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time , as you need .
But if we are talking about travelling across a city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
I think that this is the choice for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and the economy by this not only money , but the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , because they spend more time travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another person .
So , in my opinion , even after 10 years , public transport will be crossing on our street with enough number of passangers .

I really enjoyed hearing from you .
Congratulations to your sister for your prize .
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind . If I 'd have a possibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
My favourite sport is football .
When I was three years old , my parents went skiing with me .
At the beginning , I went to the childgarden and they taught me skiing .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not do it .
At twelve o'clock in the daytime , my parents took me with them and we drove together .
My father took me between his knies , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was older , I could get better . My dream was : "" SNOWBOARDING "" , but I should learn skiing perfectly like my parents .
Later , when I was 16 years old , my dream came true .
I had my first snowboard lesson and I loved it .
I took every free minute to drive a snowboard .
That was the story why I went snowboarding .
I enjoy snowboarding , because you feel free when you are driving down the piste .
You are like a bird ."

It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way home and it was getting dark .
His parents were worried and called him a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly .
Everything was dark .
She opened her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky .
A dark sky without stars .
She got up and looked around .
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness , although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to get from her house to this place .
The problem is the last thing she remembers is that she had been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
She fell asleep again , did n't she ?
If she did , how did she manage to walk until there in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , why did she n't remember anything after that ?
This situation was really frightening , not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
She started to walk to clear her mind .
She knows her way even in the dark ; she had gone to this spot a lot of time , especially the last few weeks .
The development of humankind in technology is seen everywhere .
In the case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various options , like Plan that can fly with the cloud , train that is fast and big enough that can carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boat that is much bigger and faster than ancient time .
Although compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these options .
However , if I have given the option to choose between all three , I will say plane .
There are three reasons to choose this .
First reason is its speed . Compared to both other means of transportation , it can travel faster .
It can travel thousand of miles in a couple of hours .
As a result , people can save their time .
Second is safety , compared to other factors , the chances of an accident are less .
That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than by train or boat .
Third one is comfort level .
The plan is much more comfortable than both the train and boat .
In conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice for all of three means of transportation .
The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that make plan my first choice .

Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing , I am in another world , in which I can be free and happy . Apart from this , when I am bad , this is a distration of university .
You should try it . It is so funny , but I advertise you . It is not easy at first , but you have to aim many times like you should do in life ."
70,"guide the people and give them information , details and guidelines about pollution .
I 'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant . Its name is "" Lemon "" . I go there every week . It has different food from any restaurants . I 'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce . It 's an Excellent choice for me and my favorite ingredient is sugar and in order of desert I 'd rather "" Vadge "" cake with chocolate sauce . I feel I ' m at ease when I go there . I enjoy classical music over having a lunch . The service is very good and all the staff are respectable . I ca n't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts . I advise any one to go there and enjoy a time there . Also , this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene . It 's excellent . This is a good thing for anyone . Despite all of these advantages , prices are not expensive .
Volleyball is one of the most difficult sports in the world . You should put your body in the correct form to throw the ball to the other side of the game ."
73,"Different experts have talked about this question and there are so many opinions .
People like to have the freedom to move comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only may use public transport in the moment that the timetable lets you .
In this way , many people do n't like to use public transport because they want to move themselves when they need it .
On the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the commodity of people maybe is going to determine the most use of the cars than public transport .

He did n't care .
He thought it was her fault that she had lost their little human .
Gliding in the waves
Even if I am not very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weight , able to do a lot of movement that is impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to practice swimming in the pool because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
If you are not a good swimmer , you lose the big part of the pleasure of enjoying the water , both in the sea or in the pool .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because it is fairly simple and it can give a lot of satisfactions !"

The advertising is everywhere .
There are adds in TV , radio , buses , streets ...
In spite of this range of media , TV continues to be the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television , but is it like that ?
On the one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , has a lot of mentions of products or services .
There can be people tired of so much advertising , but this is completely necessary .
There are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to report to people .
The TV is the most accessible way of communication and people can see the messages on this way .
In addition , behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In addition , there are , for example , the publicist 's work , companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV , but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite season of the year is summer .
Why am I making this choice ? You clearly can ask . I love sun and good weather .
Yes , it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near the sun because you end up burning by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good time to enjoy the little things life gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I love going to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends , other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or running in the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the warmness of summer .
Furthermore , you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this makes you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful colours of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous .
Dear USA SUMMER CAMPS ,
I saw your advertisement in the USA and I ' m very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising .
I ' m eighteen years old and I ' m doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment . That 's why I need to work in order to pay my fee .
I have some experience working with children of all ages . Besides , I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly .
Also , I ' ve just got my FCE certificate this year , but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and above all patient , therefore I think I ' m suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily to any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas , plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people and a different culture .
I ' m looking forward to hearing from you soon ."
81,"Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
Activities to kill time
As our town is well - known for its magnificulous beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beach or canoening and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too ."
85,"It would be a pleasure to discuss personally why I am qualified for this position .
I expect a prompt response from the Company .
Without further ado , I remain yours ."
82,"However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
Other ideas to have fun
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library groups , theatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
Recommendation
So , finally , I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .
If you tried all the activities , you would have a great time here , in Castelldefels !
Hi Jane ,"
84,"I was glad to hear from you .
I ' m writing to tell you the best way to arrive at Salou .
You will come to the Reus airport , right ?
Well , the airport is located just outside Reus . It 's small , but it has a lot of services and transport .
You have to take a bus because it is more economical than taking a taxi .
The bus stops at the Salou bus station .
When you get off the bus , you should ask someone for the Spring Street .

Nowadays , there are many people that are learning foreign languages . It is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that people who know how to speak foreign languages have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , there are more benefits . For example , if you want to travel to another country , it is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
Today globalization is bringing the world more close . That means that there are more possibilities to have contact with other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive for different aspects , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

However , only one thing that we dislike .
With the purpose to attract more people to join the club , it emphasises its good points . I will highly recommend that they arrange the time suitably and that they hold the acivities to avoid problems .
Given is a diagram introducing the procedures of making bank notes .
Desginating the bank notes is the first and indispensable step .
Peple should decide the background colour and artwork while they have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third section is to print the prepared bank notes .
Usually there will be 50 notes per sheet .
The colour will be printed on both sides and every note has its unique ink . Also , the images will be slightly raised .
After that , it comes to the most significant stage , which is inspecting the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually divide the quality into three parts : Good quality , Partially damaged , and bad sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets , but still good , people cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispute and distribute the bank notes .
If the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely distoryed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .
Even though it seems to be easy to make them , every step needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE"

Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and the happiness of people .
He started to think about how he could improve our lives and he found a solution .
A concerned population
While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned about the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places , making it a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
Easy recycling
Local authorities helped this initiative by creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
The results
As a result of this attitude , since Alfred had this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .
People now are worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet . Green Planet is called .
We want a happy Earth .
Hello Luis Blanco ,
I ' m writing you about the staff recruitment for the "" New Cloud Generation "" project .
So we need your help with some questions about the process .
For your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have a high team work skill .
We also value that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology , and hosting management .
However , it 's possible that we do n't find enough people with that profile , so , we could accept people with one year of experience .
Is it possible to do the meeting this week ?
When and where do you prefer ? ( Remember that I work from 8 a.m to 6 p.m ) I suggest we can do the meeting at your office , so you do n't have to move to another place .
Finally , I need you to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find another different request than I told you before in that e - mail .
Please , answer me with the information as soon as possible ."

92,"What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been helped at a concert ?
It was a really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy that very much .
You probably wo n't believe me , but I met all members of the Dem band , I talked to them and we had lunch together . They 're very nice men . Because of helping them , I had the best place during the concert and I have their authographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
In general , I had only one duty that is checking the quest list , above that I had to help in cleaning area after the concert .
But that concert was worth my work , so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
Working for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .

I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes .
My hobbies are travelling , reading stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information , so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world , in addition to becoming a member of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
It is n't just a dream in my mind , but I work hard to make this dream come true .
Last two years , I worked in many places , such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and the water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our lives . So I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer , but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
When I work anything , I feel that I have the world in my hand , so I can do anything for people .
One of my goals in life is to invent an effective drug for one of the incurable like cancer , AIDS and hepatitis .
I have asked myself many times what is the aim of our life ?
And what are the benefits of work and studying ?
But if you see your world and realize it well , it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learnt from Research that you can do everything at anytime . In addition , being tired can change your life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travelling to all the countries in the world also . I attended a lot of conferences in my field , so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for community services and development in my society as I hope to come back and teach others what I learn .

I am keen on cinema , so I love to watch all kinds of movies .
But , what films are in my Top 100 list ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is one of the top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settings are very realistic and the actors had a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama lovers watch Babel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .

Is there a future for privately owned cars ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Although privately oned cars are becoming more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and on our planet there is an increasing problem of space and pollution .
Carbon based fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probably private care will not be "" sustainable "" in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow by a staggering 3 billion human beings .
I know that it is nice to dream of a future of technological people flying around , each of them with their own private small helicopter ."
99,"Although the federal government which is decided as a role of the USA has many benefits according to the reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The powerful of the federalism which has more freedom for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture , where it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the marriage of homosexuals , where some states admit this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even though the federal government let each state function independently , it still controls the main decisions .
This case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of the federal government to stop illegal immigration to the USA through Nevada desert .
also , the control of the federal government is the reason why each state and the federal blame each other for the increase in unemployment in some states
In conclusion , the federal government which gives freedom and is powerful causes many problems , such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .

Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to view each other 's appearances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than having to call them .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communication skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention to how Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoiding using them most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits of using Facebook and Twitter are that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggressively against each other , because of lack of privacy .

100,"I think that any type of trip is exciting but also has its frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico , I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with your travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead of criticising spicy savor .
People say that on every voyage people suffer from different moments of the trip : arriving , getting away from the frustration of an unknown place , getting alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arriving home triumphal .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico , I suggest that the traveler find a way to get alone with his or her companion .
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other cities .
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion , you could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interest , such as museums or malls .
Another advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that they enjoy Mexican food .
Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people that do n't like spicy food and also most of the times they could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .
As advice , I would suggest you to ask for sauces with lower pepper .
In this way , visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors coming to my country : Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed for the first time on August 29th 1969 , the Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced face to face communication .
SMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Unsurprisingly , the social consequences of Facebook and Twitter play an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general are not likely to have their own personal privacy , so there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
This essay will focus on the benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments on the future of these technologies .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .
The benefit of being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in which their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook is interacted with by others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .
( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activity which is posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond as a public opinion .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond as a public opinion .
Most Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention to what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comments .
First of all , people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunger Game was released , a fan posted an onset racist tweet saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by a Black person ( Rauch and Schanz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) ."
