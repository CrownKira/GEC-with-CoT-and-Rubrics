If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be more serious than before .
In my city , Taipei , we are always stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine how long I would take to get to school if there was no bus or MRT .
The car is convenient for humans , but it brings damage for humans too .
For example , carbon dioxide , which is emitted by cars .
It causes global warming , which threatens our environment and harms our daily life .
We can see that there are lots of serious and frequent weather - related disasters happening in recent decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wild fires and mud slides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped .
If the film does n'""'""'t arrive on time , it immediately .
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process is started right away .
The pleasure of traveling
People go , people come .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what ' "" ' "" 's the best way to do an international travel ?
The most important option for travel is , by far , the plane .
But , even when it ' "" ' "" 's true that it ' "" ' "" 's the faster option , you must be very carefuly at time to get off a plane .
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy on the trip .
However , the best option is to choose a train .
There is n'""'""'t comparation on watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel itself .
Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many of kinds of transportation . Now we travel by car , but in the near future there will be other comfortable and easy ways to travel , like fast trains and planes that can transport you from north to south in less than an hour . This will make businessmen happy and comfortable , because of saving a lot of time and effort , so we hope that the government can achieve this as soon as possible .
In modern societies , there are lots of friends in our daily lives .
Big projects could not be finished without cooperation .
Friends can communicate and exchange ideas , feelings and funny things that happen around us .
More importantly , parents give us life and they teach us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this case , family members play important roles in our daily lives .
The reasons are as follows .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience . '"
2,"' Volleyball is a sport play every place , when I travel on the beach I like plays with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is great fun .
When I was young I liked playing with a ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a volleyball net .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I ' "" ' "" ' m writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to visit .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Madrid you can visit "" Puerta del Sol "" , "" Las Cibeles "" .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
Every summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are few jobs because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want , I will look for a job for you .
My best friend is looking for a person responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you would have to look after her every weekend .
Would you be interested in this job ?
Thank you for your e - mail . It was wonderful to hear from you .
I ' "" ' "" ' m looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on doing so in the future .
Because public transport is a more cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
Also , people need not suffer the high operating cost of running their own car .
But can use a cheaper way of going to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for travelling to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and travel on a public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n'""'""'t have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .
If we think about it the car is better because we do n'""'""'t need to wait for them has we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way car cust more money than the public transport .
By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n'""'""'t need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n'""'""'t need necessarialy to end up with the public transport . '"
3,"' If I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably chose car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the garden , with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
At some strategic points in the building , we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and plastic bottles and they also give talks and presentations about the earth 's problems , like global warming , pollution , etc .
The manager of this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us all , over the years , a recognised ecological community .
Good morning everyone . Today I want to share about my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football . Why do I choose it ? Well , football is an international sport . People around the world love it so much ! Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .
I believe that ' "" ' "" 's all will delighted us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant . They have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was : to be a super hero !
After many years , he still dreamt of becoming a super hero .
He went to university to study medicine because he thought that that profession was the most similar to being a super hero .
After some years at university he met a girl called Kate and he fell in love with her and she fell in love with him .
Kate was attending university to study fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate was so happy , until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero , Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero do n'""'""'t exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad saying that she was lying and do n'""'""'t have heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
The following day , she said sorry and they were happy again .
But when they got to Michael 's house , they fought again and Michael got a knife and kill her .
He cried with a lot of blood around .
Michael got away from there .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings a number of benefits in our life .
For instance , we take the subway in order to avoid being stuck in traffic .
It is true that travelling by car is more convenient than taking public transportation . However , it will cause more damage to our life and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offsprings . '"
1,"' It ' "" ' "" 's difficult answer at the question "" what are you going to do in the future ? "" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n'""'""'t know why .
I would like to study Psychology , because one day I would like to open my own psychology clinic and help people .
It ' "" ' "" 's difficult because I ' "" ' "" 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you ' "" ' "" 'll study it easier .
Maybe I ' "" ' "" 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always exist in the future .
Rich people will buy a car , but poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider it more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you ' "" ' "" 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience when I did n'""'""'t have a car I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n'""'""'t necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you realized the importance of a public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , like , bikes , cars , trains & planes .
Depending on the distance and time to the desired destination , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been on and the place I visited was Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We stopped at hotels to have food and just in case any of us felt hungry , we purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I organized many sports activities before at my school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family think that my cooking is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you .
Thanks
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love plays with my friends . '"
9,"' In my opinion public transport wo n'""'""'t be suffered by the shortage in demand .
Because not everyone can afford to buy their own car .
Besides there are lots of low income people who ca n'""'""'t buy their own car .
So I think public transport ' "" ' "" 's future is bright .
What does "" Family "" mean ?
In my opinion , a family is the place that you and your best friend can help each other and know each other .
In the Taiwan , many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old , but the point is what if you can not survival , I mean you do n'""'""'t have enough money to raise you parent .
Back to the topic , I do n'""'""'t know well any of member of in my family , I do n'""'""'t trust them , honestly .
I like New Zealand because there are many islands .
By the way , New Zealand has cool weather .
In Malaysia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
That ' "" ' "" 's why I order all of you to go there and feel the pleasure and have a try their own food .
You can also buy a lot of gifts , like key chains , statues , or what else memories to be made before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to New Zealand , but believe me it is a very beautiful place .
If I have the means , I will go there and take all of you .
I live in Lentini , a small city in East Sicily .
The local Council hasn'""'""'t a project for the environment .
People collect any kind of rubbish and throw it all together in a black sack .
Although the Council began to plan something , the people are n'""'""'t committed with the problem .
Around the city , you can find many places where people throw fridges , ovens , "" amianto "" , old things or furniture .
What a pity !
The suburbs of Lentini could be wonderful .
There are orange trees , a large lake and Etna in the background .
When I was a child , I had a lot of friends and they were very important to me .
We ever played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laughed a lot ...
But when I was a teenager , I began to live situations that I did not like . For instance , the girls said bad things or they talked bad about me .
In those years , I lived the worst moments of my life .
I remember when I celebrated my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party . I think that that day was one of the worst days of my life .
That night I cried because I felt that I had not got any friends .
However , my parents tried that my party was the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and together went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents . '"
6,"' I screamed , my anger had dominated my mind i did nt had no longer control over my actions , i was afarid of what i had become and what i could do , but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange , the best revange .
But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and greater . I had made a decision and I was going to do it . If he dedicated 4 years of his life to torturing me and not wanting me to be happy , the time is necessary for him to have a miserable life and I wo n't stop until I have accomplished my goal .
I ' "" ' "" ' m not agree with this idea completely .
On the one hand , travel by car is really much more convenient , as it gives you the chance to be independent .
On the other hand , huge traffic jams are a big issue when travelling by car .
My favourite sport
I was born to be a football player .
For me , football is everything in my life .
When I watch football on television I dream of playing in a big team and in a big championship like the Barclays Premier League , Ligue 1 or Liga BBVA .
My favourite clubs are Benfica and Real Madrid , where Ronaldo plays . For me , he is the best player in the world . That is why Ronaldo won the Gold ball in 2014 .
I play football for a Portuguese club called Valenciano and we won a lot of games this season .
I dream of winning a lot of leagues in football and winning the best championship , the Uefa Champions League , and the best scorer of all time in Uefa Champions League is Cristiano Ronaldo , my favourite player .
I play football because I like it but the only reason that I do it hardly is because of my dad .
His dream is that I become the captain of a big team and win a lot of money .
My name is Jonny .
I graduated from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology .
I am 25 years old .

Public transportation has been used by people more and over the years it has been kind of becoming cheaper and also safer , but some people prefer cars . To what extent do we agree with this and what are our reasons for that ? That is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay .
About 40 years ago , there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there were not even good facilities to move from one place to another and that is because there were no companies to build cars . After about 10 years , car trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans . At the beginning , they faced a lot of problems , but they were able to solve them in the end .
Nowadays all modes of transport are more convenient , from cars to buses , even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they do not like crowded places or because they find it cheaper sometimes , but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster . But when it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer driving their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy themselves more by avoiding crowded places .
To summarise , it is different from some oneis opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more , and that in the end , cars will disappear and will no longer be used .
The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and the exponential growth in their sales figures and , with low budget private cars in the picture , the scenario has drastically changed in the past 10 years .
Development of the biodiesel industry can make a contribution to productivity growth .
A large scale of investment was brought to biofuel development .
Meanwhile , it boosted economic growth and job opportunities , thereby enhancing Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
If you live in a big town or a small one , it does n't matter , but one thing that should be taken care of by the people and organisers of the town , is the environment .
Global warming is huge issue in today ' "" ' "" 's date .
Governments should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However , we , the people , play a really important part in making it worse .
Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment for their people .
Recycling items can be a good step to start with for a clean and safe environment , which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city .
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home according to a rule of the provincial government .
People do not realize that cutting down a tree can reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere .
Eventually human will have no more fresh air to breath . '"
8,"' Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public area and under 18 year old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest our neighbour cities take part in cleaning the environment so one day it can be seen in the whole country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football .
In our school or football stadium , I spend a lot of time every day .
Usually , I play football with my classmates .
Before training , I run 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs get power and my body gets energy .
Our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us on how to improve our football skills .
His main words : "" You must work and work very hard if you want to get good results "" .
I can say that this coach is an experienced person .
Not so long ago , we had a competition .
We won first place .
We achieved this result because we are friendly and organised .
I believe that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Skhatar or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to give advice to anyone who starts this sport : "" You must believe in yourself "" .

Dear Paul ,
I have seen your notice in the academy newspaper and I ' "" ' "" ' m quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK , so I could be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years later , so I could speak with them in Spanish if it was necessary .
Also , I assisted in a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
It was a long time ago , but , I still keep the rhythm in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n'""'""'t forget it because I felt wonderful .
All members congratulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I took care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
You must know that I ' "" ' "" ' m a very responsible , kind and funny person .
That makes me a good candidate to get the job , or the hobby for me !
I hope you keep in mind my candidature because I ' "" ' "" ' m not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia . '"
