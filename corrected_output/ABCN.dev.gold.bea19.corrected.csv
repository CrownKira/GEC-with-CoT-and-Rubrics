2,My name is Sarah .
3,"I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family think that my cook is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you ."
1,"It 's difficult to answer the question "" what are you going to do in the future ? "" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . In that moment you realized the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Car , Train & Flight .
Depending on the distance and duration of the desired place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently visited and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by National Highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels for food and just in case any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient ."
5,"But , if you want , I look for a job from you .
My best friend is looking for people responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after her every weekend .
You will be interesting in this job ?
Thank you for your email , it was wonderful to hear from you .
I ' m looking forward to seeing you ."

My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played every place . When I travel on the beach , I like playing with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young I like playing with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I ' m writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country is available .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Madrid you can visit "" Puerta del Sol "" , "" Las Cibeles "" .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad ."
