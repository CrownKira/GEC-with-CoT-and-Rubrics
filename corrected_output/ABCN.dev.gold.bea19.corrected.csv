2,"I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family think that my cook is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you ."

You will be interesting in this job ?

My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played every place . When I travel on the beach , I like playing with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I like playing with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I ' m writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country is available .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Madrid you can visit "" Puerta del Sol "" , "" Las Cibeles "" .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad ."
1,"It 's difficult to answer the question "" what are you going to do in the future ? "" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . At that moment , you realized the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Car , Train & Flight .
Depending on the distance and duration of the desired place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by National Highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels for food and just in case any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since , we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah ."
5,"Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in the mass transport system .
Also , people need not to suffer high operating costs running their own car .
But they can use a cheaper way to get to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
In my opinion , public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport will continue to have a future , but people are going to use more cars than buses or underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them because we are waiting for the bus or underground , but in another way , the car costs more money than public transport .
By car , we can just stay with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned , but if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with public transport .
If I had to choose between both transportation , I think I would probably choose the car , because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building , we have special trashcans to separate the garbage from organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles , and they also made talks and presentations about earth problems , like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us all over the years a recognised ecological community .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share what is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football . Why do I choose it ? Well , football is an international sport . People around the world will love it so much ! Example like the Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .
I believe that 's all about us ."
9,"The pleasure of travelling is not travelling at all .
Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many kinds of transportation now , we travel by car , but in the near future there will be other comfort and easy ways to travel , like fast trains and planes that can transport you from north to south in less than an hour . This will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of time and efforts , so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible .
In modern societies , there are lots of friends around our daily lives ."
8,"People go , people come .
Every day , lots of people are travelling abroad , but what 's the best way to do international travel ?
The most important option to travel is , by far , the plane .
But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very careful at time to get off a plane .
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy on the trip .
Although , the better option is to pick out a train .
There is n't a comparison between watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go ."
11,"I went to the abandon house and started to think the best way to make his life miserable . I spent the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him sufer .
As I did n't find anything , I went to the place he lived at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he cared about , so as I continued to go to his houes , I noticed he would alays go to tehe same house , so I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a girl who might be his girlfriend , so I finally got a idea . I would drive him crazy just as he did with me , that way she would think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son , I thought about it again and realized that if I did that she would try to help him and they would be more united , so I decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death , just as he did with me !
But wait a minute , am I really so angry to make this happen ?"
6,"By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant , they have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was : to be a super hero !
After many years , he still dreamt of becoming a super hero .
He entered the university of medicine because he thought that this profession was more similar to being a super hero .
After some years at university , he met a girl called Kate and he got loved on here and she loved him .
Kate was cursing the university of fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day , Michael said to Kate that he dreamt of being a super hero . Kate got so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero did n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad saying that she was lying and did n't have heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
The following day , she said sorry and they were happy again .
But when they got to the home of Michael , they fought again and Michael got a knife and killed her .
He cried with a lot of blood around .
Michael got away from there ."
10,"A big project could not be finished without co - operations .
Friends could communicate and exchange ideas , feelings and funny things about ourselves .
More importantly , parents give our lives and they give us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this case , the families play important roles in their daily lives .
The reasons are as follows .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from parents .
Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficulties were told to families , the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
All in all , in this case , the families are the most important friends in our lives .
Computing Technology has been advancing very much this last year , making old computers almost useless , getting better and making the difference between old and new computers grow even more with every new discovery .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different . Starting from the size of the computers , old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Old computers used to occupy one entire room . Now , they only have the size of a box , even the size of a book .
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place you visit .
Old computers only let you make math tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videogames , writing or reading a book , connecting to the internet , watching or making videos , inventing new stuff to improve the Computing Technology , and not only in 2 colors , but thousand of them .
One of the greatest achievements of new computing , is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc . via Ethernet cable or Wireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .

7,"Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings a tremendous amount of benefits to our lives .
For instance , we take the subway in order to avoid getting stuck in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our descendants .
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be more serious than before .
In my country , Taiwan , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine if there was no bus or MRT , how long I would have to get to school .
A car is convenient for humans , but it brings damage for humans also .
For example , carbon dioxide which is created by cars .
It causes global warming which threatens our environment and harms our daily life .
We can see that there have been lots of serious and frequently weather disasters in decades , such as typhoon , hurricane , wild fire and mud slide .
What other precautions are usually taken ?

12,"Yes !
I screamed . My anger had dominated my mind . I did n't have no longer control over my actions . I was afarid of what I had become and what I could do , but I could not control my self and the only thing I could think of was him suffering a slow death and the pain I would feel when I finally had my revange , the best revange .
But I was so mad at him and so angry at myself for trying to make his life imposible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering I had been doing became stronger and bigger . I had made a decision . I was going to do it . If he dedicated 4 years of his life to following me and not wanting me to be happy , I would think it was nesesary for him to have a miserable life and I wo n't stop until I had acomplished my goal .
I do not agree with this idea completely ."

Public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it has kind of become cheaper and also more safe , but some people prefer cars to others . What do we agree with and what are our reasons for that that is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay .
before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there was not even a good facility to move from place to place and that is because there were no companies to build cars . In about 10 years cars became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans . At the beginning , the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve them by the end .
Nowadays , all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses , even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they do like crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places .
To summaries , it is different from some one opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more , that by the end cars will disappear and will no longer be used
The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in the picture , scenario has changed in the past 10 years
Development of the biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth .
A large scale of investment was brought for biofuel development .
Meanwhile , it boosts economic growth and jobs opportunities , thereby increasing the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
If you are living in a big town or small town , it does matter , but one thing should be taken care of by the people and organiser of the town , is the environment .
Global warming is a huge issue in today 's date .
The government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However , we the people have a really important part of making it worse .
Active and good governments understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
Recycling items can be a good step to start with a clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city .
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of the provincial government .
People are not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere .
Eventually , humans will have no more fresh air to breath .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and under 18 years old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment in the city ."
13,"On the one hand , travelling by car is really much more convenient as it gives the chance to you to be independent .
On the other hand , huge traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car .
My favourite sport
I want to be a football player .
For me , football is everything in my life .
When I see football on television , I dream of playing in a big team and in a big championship like the Barclays Premier League , Ligue 1 or Liga BBVA .
My favourite clubs are Benfica and Real Madrid , where Ronaldo plays . For me , he is the Best Player in the world . That is why Ronaldo won the Gold Ball in 2014 .
I play football for a Portuguese club called Valenciano and we won a lot of games this season .
I dream of winning a lot of leagues in football and winning the best championship , the Uefa Champions League and the best scorer of all the time in the Uefa Champions League is Cristiano Ronaldo , my favourite player .
I play football because I like it , but the only reason that I do it hardly is because of my dad .
His dream is that I become the captain of a big team and win a lot of money .
My name is Jonny .
I graduated from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology .
I am 25 years old .
I am interested in looking after chilren and playing with chilfen .
I like personality with childlike qualities , so I like children .
I had experience of holding a basketball competition when I was a student .
I planned many interesting activities to make competition alive .
They enjoyed the game .
I also like to cook .
If my mom cooks , I always help her .
My personality is cheerful , energetic and hardworking .
I always listen to people .
I really want to get this job .
I want to play with children and see their faces all day .
I think that smile is the best gift in this world .
I am also a hard worker .
I have passion for this job ."
15,"In conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbour cities to take part in cleaning the environment so that one day it can be seen in the whole country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football .
At our school or villiage football stadium , I spend a lot of time every day .
Usually I play football with my classmates .
Before training , I ran 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs got a power and my body got an energy .
Our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us on how to improve our football skills .
His main words : "" You must work and work very hard , if you want to get high results "" .
I can say that the coach is an experienced person .
Not so long ago , we had competition .
The first place was won by us .
We achieved this result because we are friendly and organised .
I believe that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Skhatar or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport : "" You must believe in yourself "" .

Dear Paul ,
I have seen your notice in the academy newspaper and I ' m quite interested . I have no plans for this summer , so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK , so I can be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years later , I can speak with them in Spanish if it is necessary .
Also , I assisted in a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
It was a lot of time ago , but I still keep the rhthym in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to create dynamic training to do with the other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
All members congratulated me , as well ."
19,"On the other hand , I had taken care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
You must know that I ' m a very responsible , kind and funny person .
That makes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or the hobby for me !
I hope you keep in mind my candidature because I ' m not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion , public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in demand .
Because not everyone can afford to buy their own car .
Besides , there are lots of low income people who ca n't buy their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is the "" Family "" meaning ?
In my opinion , Family is the place that you and your best friend can help each other and know each other .
In Taiwan , many people have to take care of their parents when they get old , but the point is what if you can not survive ? I mean you do n't have enough money to raise you parent .
Back to the topic , I do n't know well any members of my family . I do n't trust them , honestly .
I like New Zealand because there are many islands .
By the way , New Zealand has cool weather .
In Malaysia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
That 's why I order all of you to go there and feel the pleasure and have a try their own food .
You can also buy a lot of gifts like key chains , statues , or what else memories to make before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to New Zealand , but believe me it is a very beautiful place ."

I live in Lentini , a small city in East Sicily .
The local council has n't done a project for the environment .
People collect any kind of rubbish and throw it all together in a black sack .
Although the council began to plan something , the people are n't committed to solving the problem .
Around the city , you can find many places where people throw frigo , kitchen , "" amianto "" , old things or furniture .

When I was a child , I had a lot of friends and they were very important to me .
We ever played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laughed a lot ...
But when I was a teenager , I began to live situations that I did not like . For instance , the girls said bad things or they talked bad about me .
In those years , I lived the worst moments of my life .
I remember when I celebrated my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party . I think that that day was one of the worst days of my life .
That night I cried because I felt that I had not got any friends .
However , my parents tried to make my party the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and together went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents .
In that moment , I thought that my best friends were my parents and sister .
I knew that they never talked bad about me .
Now , my husband is my best friend .
He is the most important person in my life .
He has ever been with me .
Also , he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him .
Both like to travel around the world and to practise some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekking .
We like watching TV series and cooking several desserts too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially David , my husband .
The lives of people around the globe are becoming busier and busier day by day .
A busy life always compells to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made the public transportation system lag behind motor cars .

In conclusion , it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel for better education prospects and a stable environment for younger generation to grow up .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs . Economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of brain drain should be tackled at international and national level on a broader dimension and rational pattern , because it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting up the infrastructure and law enforcement to support the public in a positive way .

Technology has changed people 's lives very much . In fact , we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents ' lives . For example , my parents did n't watch TV , because there was n't any tv in the world when they were young . But it is n't the only difference : we can think at the mobile phone , the computer , or at least the internet . Our grandparents could n't imagine a strange machine like a computer in their life .
Despite the fact that personal vehicles like the car are now popular , in the future , the existence of public transport will still be absolutely crucial .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing . This source of energy does n't always maintain at a constant level , but someday it will be run out .
People must find ways to use other energy sources , like nuclear electricity , wind power , public transportation , such as electric metro , use this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the use of these new types of energy . Travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than their personal car .
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas . It will become much more convenient .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the first choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the near future , almost cities in the world will become overcrowded . It will lead to many other problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air pollution .
In some countries , these problems are led by the over - use of personal vehicles .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time on traffic jams or to gradually kill themselves for breathing polluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is by public transport .
Each person should practice saving when using any source of energy to protect his own life .
In conclusion , investments on developing public transport will be increased considerably . Public transport has a bright potential and it 's stance in the future ca n't be replaced .

I think that the government has to help public transport , for example , bus , train , metro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life against pollution .
Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for parking and for the cost of fuel , and also maintenance costs .
In big cities , public transport works well because there 's a good feedback from people .
Instead , in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies it 's not convenient to invest money , because fewer people would use it .
Tom Sawyer was a boy that lived with his aunt Polly and she had to punish Tom because sometimes Tom did n't go to school .
On Monday , Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend Huck , which they talked a lot and Tom exchanged a tick for his tooth .
Then he saw a beautiful girl named Becky , so Tom talked to her at school and they went into a secret garden and Tom kissed Becky .

Tom was so sad because Becky did n't talk with him , so Tom went on a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks .

So they went to the misterious house and when they were inside they heard voices , so Tom and Huck hid and they saw that Injuin Joe was the one that was talking .

No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travelling , so it has a future .
Currently , most people are used to using their own car to get to work or to go shopping , because it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject , they would n't use their own car so much .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all , you need to afford to buy it . After that , you must pay for the assurance , council tax , and mechanic bills , and so on .
whereas in public transport , you only have to pay the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breaks down , it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollutes less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has a future , and the more people use it , the more future it will have .

28,"I ' m a forensic biologist and I deeply love my job .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects .
It is dynamic , stimulating and , even if it is not well paid , I feel satisfied .
In the last few years , forensic biology has developed many aspects , like better sensibility , robustness of results and less time required to analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Here is one question : do television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience , I believe television covers both entertaining and educational functions .
It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learns different basics from a great deal of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
It also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart from educational contents , there are so many foul contents , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .
However , I believe educational programmes on TV still play a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think the best restaurant where we can go is "" the sailor 's restaurant "" .
Here we can eat typical Italian food .
The last time I was here , I ate the best pizza that I have ever eaten in my life .
The atmosphere reminds me of the sea . In fact , the walls are decorated with a lot of shell and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , it 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit all together at the same table ."

My name is Steven and I ' m 14 years old . I ' m living in germany .

Run for your life
My favourite sport is running .
I like running fast , so fast in fact that it feels as if I run on air and the feet do not hardly touch the ground between the strides .
My favourite place to run is in the forest , but I like to run sportively too .
I like to feel the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city streets .
The best advice I can give to someone who is starting the running is to start slowly and not to try to run too fast , but then to eventually build up the running week by week , so that every week you are running a little more further and a little more faster and then , after 20 years , you will be an Olympic champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the news or a show about World War One ."
31,Thank you for your message .
32,"I will do my best to answer your questions .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in a Japanese restaurant , such as "" ryotei "" and "" izakaya "" .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skills in them .
Recently , many south East Asians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Sarah 's house when suddenly he left all the bathroom dirty and went to his house .
So he went back to Sarah 's house and cleaned all the bathroom , but Sarah already knew that he left the bathroom like this , so before Michael entered to the bathroom she said : "" I know what you leave there "" and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,"

My school has a unique reputation for their friendliness and the quality of education .

Good Morning :
This is an example of my favourite sport . It is swimming since I was a child because I always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone . I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar teams sports , and always I go alone . It is n't boring for me . Moreover , I prefer going alone because nobody bothers me or I have n't waited for anybody .
I said that because when I was eleven , my best friend had been operated on her back and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spent a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hais , I hated that !
Luckily , the operation was fine and she left to come with me , and since that day I go on my own .
Swimming is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and I do n't like them so much because they like disturbing me , but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommend people who do not know swim to learn , because I am pretty sure that it likes it and later they can stop swimming .
I think that dancing is a way for self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
Dance is a passion , a type of life .
When I ' m dancing , I forget all my problems , except my stupid companions that they do n't understand anything .
But this is another theme for speaking .
When you dance , sing , or act , you are showing something to the public , something that 's important for you .
If dance is your passion , you practise every day , and you 'll keep practising all the days until you can .
If you are tired , it does n't matter , because you like that you 're doing .
You 'll wake up early for going dancing , or doing dance classes .
It does n't matter if you go to sleep late , or do n't sleep ...
That 's a joke . You must sleep .
If you love dance , you 'll understand me .

We think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will disappear . After that we will be having wars .
In 30 years , we will have changed our anatomy . Also , we will be eating fast food . On the other hand , the north pole will have melted totally .
The temperature will have become crazy by global warming , so some people will have died because natural disasters will be more aggressive .
Technology will have advanced and maybe cars will be flying on the streets and computers will have totally changed .
Because of this , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and we help the planet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
How to make friends and meet new people ?
It is easier than you think .
Just ... start talking !
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calmly talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find a point between your opinion and your friend 's opinion .
Just try , it wo n't cost you much !"

Regarding the above , I advise all rookies to start practicing this sport and they will get many benefits .
However , the adults can practise it as well and they will get the same benefits .
As citizens of our village , we totally care about the environment of our village .
Every sunday , we do a mutual cooporation where anyone can treat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
We clean the dirty ditch , sweep rubbish , then we bury rubbish .
Whilst we recycle inorganic rubbish too .
From inorganic , we can make bags , hats and other stuffs .
Then they can sell them and get income from it .
The creator of the haven and the earth , the creator of soles , the one who makes earth rotate around it self and around the sun .
What we believe as Muslims that we have created by one who does n't have another with him is the one who created our father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Eve ) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree , but Satan deceived them , so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. who they worship the same one ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the hell . So because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .

Last year , my friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition . He liked the idea so he decided to enter the competition .
But there was a fee in order to enter the competition . He had no money . Fortunately , he has a lot of friends who can lend him money .
He phoned me and asked me to lend him some money to register for the competition .
He took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started writing the story . After long time spent writing and doing a good job , he went to give his story to the international student magazine office . He found out there was a notice on the door saying that the competition had canceled . He came back vey sad and told me what had happened . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

43,"Travelling by bus is very stressful because people push me or I ca n't sit down because there is n't any chair for me .
On the other hand , in the future , maybe we would have a bus which has a chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the taxi like a car . It is so comfortable too , but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The AVE or aeroplane are a good option for long trips .
In conclusion , in the future we should have a bus that is so much more comfortable .

Dear Sir Dimara .
I am writing about a problem in my city .
I live in Patras , a big city in Greece .
In my city , all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and writing .
The vandalism in Patras has increased a lot .
Unfortunately , when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls , they do not hear us .
For our city , it is very bad because when some new people visit Patras they see that thing .
Patras is a very beautiful city and for her culture , and for her monuments .
Why see that abaser thing ?
After we have this beautiful city , we have to maintain her .
In my opinion , the police should stop the Vandalisme .
If it has police all around the city , nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something to solve that problem ."
46,"But benefits after year off will be obvious .
I live in San Miguel Almoloyan . This is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the State of Mexico . The care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the care of this .

I am interested in improving my English , so I am writing to request further information about the English course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts , and if it is possible the date exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in Cork , so it would be grateful if you could send me details of accommodation that you offer in this course .
And also , can you give me an idea of how much it would cost every different option ?
It would be useful if I could live with other students , because it is a good way to learn a language as well .
Lastly , let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .
I look forward to hearing from you ."

All around the world pupils are waiting for finishing school .
They are eager to begin a new life as adults .
But when they reach the between periods , confused feelings cross their minds .
As a rule , after last exams , they do n't know what university to choose .
What they will do in future , they see , like in a fogg .
In this way , the idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
Firstly , it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard - work studying period .
Ten or eleven years at school makes them tired , in spite of pupils who do n't notice it .
But choosing the second education is a very important step , which requires serious attitude .
Secondly , a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves in new professional activities .
Also , they would have an opportunity to be involved in volontier activity .
And thirdly , they might work for earning their own money or travel .
This year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting new power for future education .
One year is not a long period ."
40,"I met many people in the park .
I never thought about it , people got so many pets .
In the peak time , the park is very busy , even though the park is huge !
Some people are very friendly , the same as their dog .

Family is the most important institution of social life .
Every member has his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , has to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
Usually there are generation problems , sons do n't understand parents and vicecersa , but dialoging and listening to emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
Parents must give rules to sons to underline limits in social behaviour but also must listen to others ' points of views to arrange and update his knowledge .
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone gives his contribution to family duties .
Recently I saw the thriller of Mokingjay part 2 .
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before you understand it .
The first movies were amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fans of this series had been wanting this movie since the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because it is hard for little kids to understand . In my opinion , it is more a teen movie .
I think people will like this movie because it is very similar to the story of the book ; this is the first movie that is really based on the book . The theme is very unique and original . Also , the actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will put double effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the las part mokingjay !
My favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I ' ve had a very bad and stressful day , I can relax doing karate , because it 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Training Karate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your tiring routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to achieve this advantage with other sports .
Apart from that , Karate is not just a sport , it is also a discipline . It teaches you respect , balance even culture .
My teacher showed us how we have to behave with others and he taught us a lot of things about the Japanese culture .
For someone who starts Karate , it is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing ."

This subject shall be raised in all media to learn and encrage the people to use the other ways for transport .

One day , I visited Meandro del melero .
It was beautiful .
And there was a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a lot and on the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of the waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was spectacular .
On the wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and in the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the night , we had dinner in a restaurant and there was a party all night .
You should visit Las Hurdes . It is a beautiful site .
And there are a lot of things ."
53,This is all .
52,"For example , a present or a gift , especially if it is from your best friend .
Once , I got sick and stayed at the general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
It was my favorite flower I have ever had .
In my town , we create a small organization for more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be attractive . The citizens in the town must participate in this . The citizen will take responsibility for specific days to clean the town and put the rubbish into the correct place and clean the tree and plant more of it .
I ' m agreeing with the opinion that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
It is horrible to have a person following you all the time , you not have a life , not peace , not a happy life .
In adition , all pearsons have the right to privacy and to be free .
Nevertheless , journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they eat , drink , happy , sad . How is your love life and with whoever stays , if you stay with something important our what we buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privacy . The society has a blame , because if they do not take a photo , our follows the life of the famous people bored .
So that politicians and film stars will support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have the reward for what they earn ."

English is an international language which becomes important in the modern world .
In China , English is taken to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
They begin to study English at an early age .
They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day .
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words .
That 's a good phenomenon , because English is essential nowadays .
In addition to that , some people think English is superior than Chinese .
In my opinion , though English is for great significance , but English is , after all , a foreign language .
It is hard for people to see eye to eye .
English does help us read English original works , but Chinese helps us learn a true China .
Only by characters , Chinese literature can send off its brilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , especial its classic culture , the first thing is learning its language .
Because we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our own culture through a foreign language ?
Last month I was in a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .

Once upon a time there was one little ant called Penny . He was really small compared with the others .
He hated to be like that because most of the ants made fun of him until one day something horrible and inevitable happened .
It was a dark night , it was raining until a big active volcano explosion buried them in the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one could find one ... They started to get panicked !
People just started to evacuate rapidly until it began a big earthquake ...
Penny was too sad . The only thing that he could do is to wait and keep calm .
Until the dawn , all of them go out , so they are sacred until they find refuge .
Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one found anything .
Like they were very religious ants , they prey on her sacred ancestors so they can help them in the big deal .
Something that they do n't know was that the whole thing was a movie !
So all was planned ...
The actors had monitors that watched ants all the time .
One day Penny discovered it and she went to tell it to his queen . The queen at knowing that she got very confused , but at the same time she got mad and she wanted revenge .
So they made a plan to display all ...
The next day when they were about to start filming , there were no ants there so they searched for them , but they ca n't find them ...
In that moment , the ants and Penny attack them in their backs , making them to leave the place .
The ants win the war and they expand their habitat to the studio .
No one attacks them again and they live happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of them , I ' m keen on playing basketball the best . I always spend more time playing it .
I usually play basketball every day for at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at university , I go home and then I go to the stadium to play basketball .
One thing makes sure that I have already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketball has many benefits for me but also for everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwind ."
55,"Besides , it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape ."
56,I really like it .
57,"I like playing it .
When I have spare time , I often gather my friends to watch a basketball match on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it near a sports centre .
I go back home and have a deep sleep when I finish it .
Basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's the reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming population , many agricultueal land , forest and ocesn had been destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even humans and animals .
To start with , there are a wide range of problems that could maybe lead to this phenomeon .
Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all modern cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people have now destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their needs , which will distory ecosystem diversity and biodiversity , especially endangered species .
According to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that governments should adopt to deal with this problem . First of all , reducing building constructure from now on , planting more trees instead .
Sustainadle development should be a priority for all humans and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before things get worse . Governments have to take responsibility for that .
Nowadays , languages are very important , and more English .
This is not my first time that I have studied English .
I have been studying English since I was a child and I have never spoken and learned so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I made that decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity , I said yes .
The car is n't the best way for transport , because it produces much pollution , but public transport is better for doing a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
Nowadays in cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram etc . These options are more economical than the car . The problem with the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people .
This causes many pollution for the environment , so we have more conscience for the planet health .
I want to say something about the learning of English . It is hard to get to me for the next reasons :"
39,"Nowadays , people prefer their own vehicles rather than
public transportation . Day by day people are more crazy about own vehicles which leads to a dark future of public transportation .
Firstly , I agree with given statement that there would be a tough time for public transportation in near future .because people wamnt privacy as well as freedom which is quite impossible in public transportation .
Secondly , these modes of transportation cover
as much as possible of the city area or town which has a mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation . As a consequence , generally people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I can say that there are various modes of transportation avaliable
to competition with public transportation .
Nowadays , people have numerous options for travelling , like many private companies .
Which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this , consumers get more benefits like lower faire , privacy , freedom and safe travelling . In addition , many automobile companies launcing new cars with affordable prices which insiost people to use more and more private vehicles .
I go for a walk to a park every day with my lovely two Corgi dogs ."
58,"First reason ; the grammar that learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like Spanish Languaje , my native language .
That I want to say , it is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just like in your native lenguaje .
Second reason . in English syntaxis , the structure for construction paragraphs or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but not always . Which is the rule ?
Is there anyone ?"
60,"The advice that I give to someone who wants to start swimming .
It is not afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming , and also when the age becomes older it will be more difficult to learn than the little ones .
So these are the advice that I give to them ."
59,"The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic about this game .
My favourite team is India because I belong to this country .
In India , 85 percent of people follow cricket .
In 1993 , the Indian cricket team won their first world cup and that 's changed the direction of air in favour of cricket and everyone started to follow this game .
I love this game because my favourite sport man belongs to this game .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulakar , known as a little master .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow this person .
His stance , style , shots , running between the wickets , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not only me , but also every Indian always follows Sachin for cricket .
When he was 18 , he played his first game for India .
He is the first player to play a 200 test in cricket .
He has many achievements , like first 200 in one day etc .
I love the way he was played .
First , they have to decide what they do better , batting or bowling .
If the person wants to become a bowler , then concentrate on running , action , stance and for batsmen , concentration on lag and bat coordination , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which became key factors in batting .
Also watch videos of some of the best players , like Sachin , Rahul , Sir Don breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaram , Brett Lee etc .
As health is an important factor in every sport , so also need to improve health , stamina .
Dear Jo ,
It 's glad to hear you are going to visit my country .
I am looking forward to this .
I can give you any advice on traveling and working in my country .
I wish you will have a good time .
The weather is neither hot nor cold all year . You need n't bring too many clothes because you can buy them here .
If you want to travel this city , I can be your guide as I have a year free before university too .
This is a modern city .
People usually go here for shopping or eating .
There are many local foods very popular .
You may like this .
I also want to introduce my friends to you . We can have fun together .
When you have played enough in this city , and you want to find a job here .
I can send you to my uncle 's company to do a job .
Because it is difficult to get a job here if you are foreign and have n't finished college .
It may take very long to find a job and you have not spent much time here .
You may consider my advice .
My favorite sport is swimming .
It 's because swimming is really fun .
Also , I think swimming can keep our bodies fit and it can make people who swim feel cool when it is a hot day ."
62,"The city where I live is a small village .
All residents take great care of the environment .
Organized shares , where everyone cleans up the village .
All residents segregate garbage into suitable containers .
Thus helping to protect our environment to make it clean , safe , in order to not jeopardize our various diseases .
In my village there are trash cans , so that no one throws debris on the ground .
There are places where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power plant .
Recently , the roof of the primary school was set up with batteries and the whole school uses solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment . Residents participate in them .
The residents of my village try to , so that our village is clear of pollution that pollutes the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride on public transportation . There are several reasons to consider .
Firstly , the bus always drops by to get a passenger that takes a longer time than expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicle route is more far than the usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and there is no privacy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and a pocket picker .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than buying a new car and for the adventurer who wants to have an exciting trip for then to see more action .
Like watching outside or sight seeing , to mingle and meet different people .
In addition to this , I also admire the bullet train in japan , which u consider a fast and safe public vehicle I have known .
To sum up , I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient .
Public future unless they have a project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger .
As far as I ' m concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extracting the mineral will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it would probably disappear if the developing equipment were being set .
Next to go , the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely lead to air pollution .
There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral .
No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important things which should be prevented .
Last but not the least , the mineral extraction will turn out to be a profound influence , especially , on our descendants ."
61,"Dear Camp director ,
My name is Eider and I am 21 years old . I had read your advertisement in the newspaper !
And I am really sure that I am the person that you are finding .
I am a monitor in my free time , and I am looking for a temporal job to improve my English .
Neither do I have problems with working in a kitchen . It will be clear if I told you that my parents have a bar .
According to my age , evening activities are not a problem for me , and I have played many sports during my life , such as football , volleyball , ...
Waiting for your answer , Eider"
63,"To take my friend , Taylor , as an example , her homeland was over - developed and became an arid place when she was a child .
After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , she has no memory of her childhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us .
Due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nutshell , Based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extracting the valuable mineral outweigh the advantage .
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of poor cars .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
Global warming is a serious issue . Higher temperatures make the ice caps melt .
The longer we burry our heads in the sand , the warmer the Earth will be .
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .
Even if it did happen , there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too expensive , not only for buying but for fuel , service and so forth .
Buses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .
And what about trains ?
I saw tv about trains in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not a stream of cars like it was in the film "" The Fifth Element ""

I know you are searching for a flat to live in for the whole next year .
Maybe I found something for you : when I was on the bus returning to home , I read a journal with some advertisements .
There is a nice flat near my home : it is perfect for someone who wants to live there for only an year .
There is a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a bathroom with shower but without a bath and a cool living - room .
I think that you have to bring winter clothes because here there is really cold weather !

69,"We should use public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harming the environment and the world .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking or running . On the other hand , it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong with going to a place in a car . Obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper , but not always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient , but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
It is commonly debated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspects of one country , but of the whole world .
Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorants .
First of all , tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongside its development , the ablity of travelling has increased to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country , but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important role in their growth from an economic point of view .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the economy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism influences the environment , it thereby influnces the environment , and if it influences the environment , it influences transport . How ? People become more careful of their historcal sites , this way preserving them .Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
At a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficiently .
At a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : on land , on sea or air .
Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations .
One time there was a tiger who lived in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 daughters .
The tiger was named Amanda of 25 years old . The herders killed her parents , because the herders were poor and did n't have enough food to survive , so they killed them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion named John of 27 years old . His dad died because in a conflict with other animals , he got an infection .
His mom died because some things or someone dragged her of the leg and dropped her in a cave and other animals ate her .
They died when John was too little to remember and he never knew what had happened , so he went to all the parts for them , even he walked and walked even in reverse , but he never found them .
The 3 daughters are so different from each other ."
68,"There are many sources and creators , as well as themes .
It is well known that many Art curators and artists believe that Contemporary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based on their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the time this is unintelligible .
Luckily , the most expensive art is still the old , like Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays , a lot of empty art pieces are being sold at auctions around the world , for extraordinary high prices .
Experimental Art has taken the world of art by surprise .
Humanity has reached a level of differences that it would not be possible to stop .
So now we have many choices and an infinite amount of information available at any given time .
With this stated , we now have an idea of how artists create .
The sports days were held at Kwai Chung Sports Ground on 12th and 13th November .
That weather was partly cloudy .
I got there by MTR .
I arrived at the sports ground at 7:40 a.m. This year I ' ve joined the 100 - metre race .
On the first day before the sports day begins , we have the opening ceremony .
The athletic representative pasted the torch and we sang the hymn .
After that , the sports day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the girl 's grade C 100 metre race started .
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal .
The teacher called my name twice and he told me to stand in a different place .
So I know that there was someone whose name was the same as me .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I was running , I heard my housemates cheering and the wind passing my face .
That feel was very comfortable and made me feel relaxed .
Finally , I got number 10 out of 27 people .
Although it is not a great result , I ' ve already tried my best .
At the end of the day , our school announced the mark the four houses have got .
My house got number two temporarily .
I felt hopeful and wanted my house to get the champion .
On the second day , my classmates called me to take part in the Inter - class relay race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running .
Finally , our class got the first runner up .
We have a difference of 0.5 seconds in the first part of the race .
I implicated my class in winning the champion .
Finally , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the champion in the next year .
"" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient "" .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct ."
70,"The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah . She is 9 years old and she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and has a lot of spots .
She is one of the ones that tend to make something enforcing .
The second daughter , Elizabeth , is a leopard who is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
She is 12 years old .
Another animal gives them rewards or bonuses because she discovers that water is liquid .
The last daughter was Ana , who was the youngest of the family and was a jaguar .
She stayed sleeping in the bed and doing nothing all day .
Their parents were angry because she was the only one that never worked .
One of the animals went with Ana and gave her an incentive to be an athlete or do something else than stay sleeping .

Hello Riley , about the question you asked me in your letter . It has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up on your music classes .
You have been taking classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free time you could still play piano without going to classes .
This is my opinion , but the decision is yours , so when you decide it , please send me a letter telling me about it ."
76,"I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was on the beach all afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people on the beach .
The water was very cold and I could n't swim . Then I played football on the sand of the beach .
I sat in the sun for a very long time and then I went to a cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I spent a good time with my family .
No future for public transpotr ? is this claim true or no ?
Will we see public transport in 5 or 10 years yet ? That is really a really interesting question/
I think that it all comes from the development .
Now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
Yes , I agree . If you plan on travelling for a long time and for a long time , you would prefer to do it in a car , because first , you 'll spend less time travelling , you will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time , as you need .
But if we are talking about travelling across a city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
I think that this is the choice for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and the economy by this not only money , but the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , because they spend more time travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another person .
So , in my opinion , even after 10 years , public transport will be crossing on our street with enough number of drivers .
Hello Lara ,"
75,"The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that make it my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to earn money or travel . It would be the best award for a student who attended high school .

It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way home and it was getting dark .
His parents were worried and called him a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly .
Everything was dark .
She opened her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky .
A dark sky without stars .
She got up and looked around .
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness , although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to get from her house to this place .
The problem is the last thing she remembers is that she had been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
She fell asleep again , did n't she ?
If she did , how did she manage to walk until there in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , why did she n't remember anything after that ?
This situation was really frustrating , not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
She started to walk to clear her mind .
She knows her way even in the dark ; she had gone to this spot a lot of time , especially the last few weeks .
The development of humankind in technology is seen everywhere .
In case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various options like a plane that can fly with the cloud , train that fast and big enough to carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient times .
Although compared to ancient times , we are lucky enough that we have all these options .
However , if I have the option to choose between all three , I will say plane .
There are three reasons to choose this .
First reason is its speed . Compared to both other means of transportation , it can travel faster .
It can travel thousand of miles in a couple of hours .
As a result , people can save their time .
Second is safety , compared to other risks of accidents are less .
That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than by train or boat .
Third one is comfort level .
Plan is much more comfortable than both trains and boats .
In conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of the three means of transportation ."

I really enjoyed hearing from you .
Congratulations to your sister for your prize .
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind . If I 'd have a possibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
My favourite sport is football .
When I was three years old , my parents went skiing with me .
At the beginning , I went to the childgarden and they taught me skiing .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not do it .
At twelve o'clock in the daytime , my parents took me with them and we drove together .
My father took me between his knies , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was older , I could get better . My dream was : "" SNOWBOARDING "" , but I should learn skiing perfectly like my parents .
Later , when I was 16 years old , my dream came true .
I had my first snowboard lesson and I loved it .
I took every free minute to drive a snowboard .
That was the story why I went snowboarding .
I enjoy snowboarding , because you feel free when you are driving down the piste .

82,"Different experts have talked about this question and there are so many opinions .
People like to have the freedom to move comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only may use public transport in the moment that the timetable lets you .
In this way , many people do n't like to use public transport because they want to move themselves when they need it .
On the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the commodity of people maybe is going to determine the most use of the cars than public transport .

The advertising is everywhere .
There are adds in TV , radio , buses , streets ...
In spite of this range of media , TV continues to be the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television , but is it like that ?
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , has a lot of mentions of products or services .
There can be people tired of so much advertising , but this is completely necessary .
There are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to report to people .
The TV is the most accesible way of communication and people can see the messages on this way .
In addition , behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In addition , there are , for example , the publicist 's work , companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV , but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite season of the year is summer .
Why am I making this choice ? You clearly can ask . I love sun and good weather .
Yes , it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near the sun because you end up burning by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good time to enjoy the little things life gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I love going to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends , other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or running in the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the warmness of summer .
Furthermore , you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this makes you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful colours of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous .

91,"Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
Activities to kill time
As our town is well - known for its magnificulous beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beach or canoening and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too ."
89,"He got closer to her and told her everything .
Mel looked sadly at Tom , then said : "" I ' m pregnant ... "" and got out of his home .
He followed and apoligized her .
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hugged her .
He said he loved her and kissed her forehead .
He had to stay with her because of ... the baby .
He could n't just leave her carrying his baby !
No ! He has never acted like this .
He knew that he had to stay with her for the rest of his life and raise the baby .
He decided to give swimming up and started to take care of Mel .
One day Mel was feeling really bad , so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt that something bad was going to happen .
And he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
Mel was crying all day and Tom could n't stand it .
He has broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
He did n't care .
He thought it was her fault that she had lost their little human .
Gliding in the waves
Even if I am not very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weight , able to do a lot of movement that is impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to practice swimming in the pool because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
If you are not a good swimmer , you lose the big part of the pleasure of enjoying the water , both in the sea or in the pool .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because it is fairly simple and it can give a lot of satisfactions !"
93,How are you ?
88,"He invited all his friends from the team and made a party .
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too .
She was really proud of him .
She was dreaming about being his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so bad .
But he did n't love her enough .
He wanted to break up with her at that party .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hated that she was always late .
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Mel came , she looked gorgeous .
And when he saw her , his heart started to beat faster and faster .
But time 's up ."
95,"It would be a pleasure to discuss personally why I am qualified for this position .
I expect a prompt response from the Company .
Without further ado , I remain yours ."
92,"However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
Other ideas to have fun
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library groups , theatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
Recommendation
So , finally , I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .
If you tried all the activities , you would have a great time here , in Castelldefels !

Nowadays , there are many people that are learning foreign languages . It is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that people who know how to speak foreign languages have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , there are more benefits . For example , if you want to travel to another country , it is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
Today globalization is bringing the world more close . That means that there are more possibilities to have contact with other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive for different aspects , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

94,"I was glad to hear from you .
I ' m writing to tell you the best way to arrive at Salou .
You will come to the Reus airport , right ?
Well , the airport is located just outside Reus . It 's small , but it has a lot of services and transport .
You have to take a bus because it is more economical than taking a taxi .
The bus stops at the Salou bus station .
When you get off the bus , you should ask someone for the Spring Street .
It 's near there .
You can walk to my house .
Moreover , I send you a map in order to locate the street .
This is my address : 4 Spruce avenue .
I ' m planning your visit .
I 'd like to visit museums , monuments and go clubbing with you .
I ' m looking forward to hearing from you soon .

Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and the happiness of people .
He started to think about how he could improve our lives and he found a solution .
A concerned population
While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned about the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places , making it a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
Easy recycling
Local authorities helped this initiative by creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
The results
As a result of this attitude , since Alfred had this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .
People now are worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet . Green Planet is called .
We want a happy Earth .
Hello Luis Blanco ,
I ' m writing to inform you about the staff recruitment for the "" New Cloud Generation "" project .
So we need your help with some questions about the process .
For your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have a high team work skill .
We also value that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology , and hosting management .
However , it 's possible that we do n't find enough people with that profile , so , we could accept people with one year of experience .
Is it possible to do the meeting this week ?
When and where do you prefer ? ( Remember that I work from 8 a.m to 6 p.m ) I suggest we can do the meeting in your office , so you do n't have to move to another place .
Finally , I need you to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find another different request than I told you before in that e - mail .
Please , answer me with the information as soon as possible ."
98,"Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to complain about a recent package I received on Monday last week .
I ordered two batteries model 002545 because my mobile needs this kind of battery , but I have only received one battery model 001212 .
One month ago , I ordered two batteries model 002545 on your online website .
I have a mobile model Nokia 1214 which needs batteries model 002545 .
The delivery was wrong , so now I am in a huge hurry because I need my mobile to work every day .
If I have not mobile , I will not be able to work .
To resolve the problem , I would like to receive the batteries by express post .
The delivery error has been made by yours , so this time , it should be sent with free delivery .
If I do not hear from you within the next two days , I will be forced to contact my solicitor .
You can only contact me by email because my mobile still does not work .
I hope to hear from you soon and have my batteries as quickly as possible in my home .
Yours faithfully ,"
102,"What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been helped at a concert ?
It was a really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy that very much .
You probably wo n't believe me , but I met all members of Dżem band . I talked to them and we had lunch together . They 're very nice men . Because of helping them , I had the best place during the concert and I have their autographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
In general , I had only one duty that is checking the quest list , above that I had to help in cleaning the area after the concert .
But that concert was worth my work , so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
Working for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .

I am keen on cinema , so I love to watch all kinds of movies .
But , what films are in my Top 100 list ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is one of the top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settings are very realistic and the actors had a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama lovers watch Babel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .

The aim of this report is to evaluate both bad effects and good effects from users ' opinions in the Active Leisure Club for the last time .
First , people in this area have actually found a suitable place to enjoy their time through a wide range of activities , games which are held creatively and effectively and have been suitable for different ages .
Besides , it has enough modern facilities to serve the users in peak hours and the guides are everywhere and ready to give a help .
However , only one thing that we dislike
With the purpose to attract more people to join the club , it emphasises its good points . I will highly recommend that they arrange the time suitably and that they hold the acivities to avoid problems .
Given is a diagram introducing the procedures of making bank notes .
Desginating the bank notes is the first and indispensable step .
Peple should decide the background colour and artwork while they have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third section is to print the prepared bank notes .
Usually there will be 50 notes per sheet .
The colour will be printed on both sides and every note has its unique ink . Also , the images will be slightly raised .
After that , it comes to the most significant stage , which is inspecting the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually divide the quality into three parts : Good quality , Partially damaged , and bad sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets , but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispact and distribute the bank notes .
If the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely distoryed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .
Even though it seems to be easy to make them , every step needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE"
106,"I have one brother and one sister .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes .
My hobbies are travelling , reading stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information , so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
It is n't just a dream in my mind , but I work hard to make this dream come true .
Last two years , I worked in many places , such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and the water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our lives . So I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer , but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
When I work anything , I feel that I have the world in my hand , so I can do anything for people .
One of my goals in life is to invent an effective drug for the incurable , like cancer , AIDS and hepatitis .
I have asked myself many times what is the aim of our life ?
And what are the benefits of work and studying ?
But if you see your world and realize it well , it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learned from research that you can do everything anytime , in addition , a little tired can change the life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travelling to all the countries in the world also . I have attended a lot of conferences in my field , so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for community services and development in my society , as I hope to come back and teach others what I have learned .
I am writing with reference to the post of job as a camp monitor that you require in summer .
I have seen your advert this morning and I am really interested in it .
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a qualified person for the post .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after children from 3 to twelve yeras old . I am quite patient and fun . In my opinion , they are two qualities highly necessary for this kind of job .
I am good too at working in a team ."
107,"I do not like to be or feel alone . This could be one of my great weaknesses .
I really love being with people all the time .
I do not think being young will be a problem .
Instead , I believe it is an advantage .
Young people are usually hard - working and active people .
If you require any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae with my telephone number . I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
I would really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
Is there a future for privately owned cars ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Although privately oned cars are becoming more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and on our planet there is an increasing problem of space and pollution .
Carbon based fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probably private care is not "" sustainable "" in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow by a staggering 3 billion human beings .
I know that it is nice to dream of a future of technological people flying around , each of them with their own private small helicopter ."
110,"Sharing houses or rooms have many advantages , such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learning how to share everything with others . Saving money and time will be more obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs .
In spite of all these benefits , I prefer - if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
Many years ago , I shared a friend in a room for a few months during a course outside my country , these days where I was dirty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . Living alone will grant me freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceed the privacy of my friends . This matter will not be achieved when living in shared rooms .
They annoying me"
108,"But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there are no helicopters , and not even cars .
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative .
The price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habits of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and learn again to be on time , the nice old train could become important again .
Imagine this picture : the first class of this semester , students are yawning and do not pay attention to the teacher . While the teacher asks for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they studied last semester .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying . Partly because of the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because the long vacation will let students used to having fun instead of studying , and partly because some difficult courses should be continually studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus that students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break .
For example , in history class , history teacher has to repeat teaching the history of North America before he starts to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester .
It is very wasting time and not efficient .
Next to go would be , students get used to relaxing by having no study and homework during the long vacation .
For example , when the semester starts , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
In class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead of paying attention to the teacher .
Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long break time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education . If you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on the aforementioned , I totally agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is soccer .
I have enjoyed this sport since I was a child . I always remember when my father and my brother taught me to play it .
My father was a professional soccer player , so I think that I inherited this love for soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am on the playing field I forget all the problems .
I like to speak with my team partners .
Together , we analyze the rival team and we choose a strategy to win the match .
When I play bad , I feel nervous but my teammates give me their unconditional support ."
109,"That is priceless .
I know health is very important , so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport , you have to do it because you really like it .
If you do n't like it , there are many options to practise whatever sports .
Soccer is not a violent sport , but sometimes it becomes .
In this way , you have to be prepared for any problem .
Finally , I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niagara Falls .
Something that made me happy was seeing my family .
On september 12th , 2014 , I went to New York City .
On the fly , I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was approximatly five hours , where I watched beautiful movies .
When I arrived , my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We went to a long island because there he lives .
He has a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin "" Angel "" who looks just like me .
In New York , I eat so much , I also went to the city thay never sleeps , Manhattan .
My uncle had the awesome idea of going to Niagara Falls .
We went in the car and it was about 8 hours long .
Finally , we arrived in Niagara Falls , which looks like a ghost place .
It does not have too much to do , but there were the falls .
I was amazed at how huge the falls were .
They were incredible amazing and beautiful .
I take too many photos because you do n't visit places like that everyday .
Something that made me very happy was to visit my family .
My uncle Juan lives in the United States of America and I was very happy to hug him because I miss him a lot .
My cousin Angel was very happy to see me and me too . We are like siblings .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she said they did not see me frecuently and many other members of my family .
In conclusion , I had a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visited awesome places such as Niagara Falls and Time Square , received a lot of presents and ate a lot of delicious food .
Most students attending universities are out of the city where they used to live , so they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
Most universities provide cheap accommodations such as shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have low incomes .
Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire apartments to live independently ."
111,"Although the federal government which is decided as a role of the USA has many benefits according to the reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The powerful of the federalism which has more freedom for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture , where it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the marriage of homosexuals , where some states admit this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even the federal government let each state function independently , it still controls the main decisions .
This case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of the federal government to stop illegal immigration to the USA through Nevada desert .
also , the control of the federal government is the reason why each state and the federal blame each other for the increase in unemployment in some states
In conclusion , the federal government which gives freedom and is powerful causes many problems , such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .

112,"I think that any type of trip is exciting but also has its frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico , I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with your travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead of criticising spicy savor .
People say that on every voyage people suffer from different moments of the trip : arriving , getting away from the frustration of an unknown place , getting alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arriving home triumphal .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico , I suggest that the traveler find a way to get alone with his or her companion .
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other cities .
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion , you could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interest , such as museums or malls .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enjoy Mexican food .
Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people that do n't like spicy food and most of the times , they could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .
As advice , I would suggest you to ask for sauces with lower pepper .
In this way , visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors coming to my country : Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed for the first time on August 29th 1969 , the Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced face to face communication .
SMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Unsurprisingly , the social consequences of Facebook and Twitter play an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general are not likely to have their own personal privacy , so there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
This essay will focus on the benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments on the future of these technologies .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .
The benefit of being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in which their negative feelings are expressed ."
115,"576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to view each other 's appearances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than having to call them .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communication skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention to how Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoiding using them most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits of using Facebook and Twitter are that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggressively against each other , because of lack of privacy .

113,"Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook is interacted with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increases continuously , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .
( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activity which is posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone .
However , information which is appearing on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond as a public opinion .
However , information which is appearing on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond as a public opinion .
Mostly , Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention to what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comments .
First of all , people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunger Game was released , a fan posted an onset racist tweet saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by a Black person ( Rauch and Schanz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) ."

As far as I ' m concerned , public transportation is the best mode of transport for environmental care .
In spite of some people making enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones that use gas or diesel ) , so people choose these ones and that 's because pollution is a major issue that we have to deal with .
Environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids to ancient people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social consumption .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow down the fee on public transportation , that could make people use public transportation and care for the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent global warming .
In Coslada City Council , people are well informed about taking care of the environment .
The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens . For example , children learn at school how to separate the waste .
There are many ecological islands .
Each of them has three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .
There have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .
But it is never enough , because dog owners have most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there are many bike paths across the city , so citizens will be able to avoid the car and they will emit less air pollution .
Organic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper waste is picked up every other day .
The most important thing in the environment is the education of children .
Our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
A problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their target of making money without thinking of the effects .
My family is very conscious of this problem , so we make any effort to solve it .
We usually use public transport , which has a great quality in the city where I live .
It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is worth it .
We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are clasified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us materials to recycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take care of the environment ."
116,"Introduction
Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs are included in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments , like birthdays , travels , special occasions , etc .
As a new college subject
This practice is considered one of those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be considered as learning to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
The reasons
Recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations of people ( teenagers and kids ) .
This increase is related to the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requires knowledge of special skills , techniques and knowledge .

Hockey as a life style
Although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey provides you more than just being healthy or fit .
What are you thinking of whenever you choose a sport ?
You think that your life style will improve ?
Well , you are mistaken .
For doing different kinds of sports , you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have any of those requirements ?
Then you know hockey is the best player .
Hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . In simple words ,
It 's a team sport .
However , it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
You have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand , I enjoy every second of it .
Through all my life , I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has become a life style for me .
Why will I recommend this to you ?"

Nowadays , we all hope that public transport can save the world .
When we see all these cars in our yards , when we stay in traffic jams , we think that one day we will have to live our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the immortal traffic jam .
But , probably , this situation is only a period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in this field .
For instance , Google reported about Googlemobile .
Maybe robots will be able to drive more smart than people .
If they will contact each other and use Googlemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
So people will be able to avoid traffic jams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think it might take away their independence .
But another group thinks that it is not a bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact that they are drivers at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike being a driver anyway .
And people who hate public transport , there will always be ."
119,"As soon as the last river ends , the southern border of Egypt is here .
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
All historians , researchers , scientists agree with this .
And , as for me , I totally support their point of view .
Egypt is a kind of river civilization among the huge desert Sahara .
All over the time , the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .
The Egyptians called their country ' Black Land ' to mark it off of the red soil of the desert .
Nowadays , the deep and wide valley of the Nile has become the most important transport line for Egypt .
Through the centuries , people have been exploring the nature of the Nile .
The ancient Egyptians divided the year into three seasons compared to a dry or wet period .
They knew when it would be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nile ' to stock up with clean water .
But such a high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive .
A great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearance of a lot of plants and animals .
Anyway , a lot of Egyptians still live far from the main water artery of the country and hardly can find clean water to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt becomes developing , the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that are high .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milano .
But Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum .
For centuries , this building had been the symbol of this city .
It was quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousand tourists , who come every year .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Tito , who was the Roman emperor .
It was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed without pity .
Moreover , navy wars were represented in order to celebrate the Roman army .
It was ruined through the ages , but now people understand its importance and take care of it .
In my opinion , it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However , not all people are aware of it .
It 's our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people have succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In this fast moving world , transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
There is no point in saying public transport has no future .
Travelling through a car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using public transport ."
122,"The question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
How many languages do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is more important to learn a foreign language than before .
There are few reasons why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak a local language . It makes your trip more easy and comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing at the national level . If you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value to your profile and you can get a higher salary .
Third , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language . At the same time you are also getting to know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours , it enriches your knowledge .
Over these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happening around the world ."
124,"Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people .
In holidays , people can avoid daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .
In this respect , many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations in their lives .
For example , walking on the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly about their experiences about life .
People can review their decisions to make holidays more accurate and helpful .
For instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .
Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
The reason is that people must complate their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings , such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly seen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings .
For example , people meet their relatives that they have never seen for a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go to sacred places in order to renew their spirits and souls .
They can pray for God and it gives a relief for people .
When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects , they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material world .
On holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that lead to a stressful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
Also , holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away from modern life that has full of material subjects .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity is not a common habit in Spain .
However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .
On the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 emissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .
Statistically , cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Getting wet when it rains , having to make a lot of effort to cycle in strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking in hot weather .
In my view , cycling contributes to improving community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking a car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway ."
123,"From newspapers , magazines , even foreign media , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greedy nature .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Various factories emit excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
The higher the temperature , the worse the living quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living places , we would have a dark and hopeless future .
Due to climate change , the weather is so hot that people could even have a water shortage .
Losing enough water supply , people 's bodies will become weak and rough .
In this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fights , hatred and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightness .
The terrible consequences are caused by humans ' unsatisfied heart .
Friends , from now on , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people . The real danger is if you get discovered .
When people know that they were deceived , that they trust were broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
The passion for the cause is the key to survival .
It is just something that I had to do , not you , not her , me .
I did n't choose that job , this job has chosen me .
Dear Sir or Madamme ,
I would like to apply for the position of beach lifeguard assistance which I saw advertised .
For the last two years , I have joined the swimming group at the University .
I have managed to succeed in many competitions in the country and abroad .
I believe I am a suitable candidate for this post , considering the swimming skills I have .
On the other hand , I completed the first aid course , in the Red Cross .
The job would give me the opportunity to use all the experience I have gained and what is more , it would provide me with new knowledge .
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you should require further information .
I am available to attend an interview at your convenience .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,

In our modern world , many people are suffering from stress that comes from life conditions .
In addition to this , people work in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave this condition during holidays ."
126,"Dear Usa Summer Camps ,"
127,"I am writing in response to your advertisement for a job .
I had a part - time job as a babysitter and I took care of my 11 - year - old brother very often .
I worked in an Easter camp too and I have already prepared a lot of activities , like "" rappel "" , paintball ...
For these reasons , I think I have the skills for the job ."
125,"And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to a less frequent schedule .
Also , we can drive a car to any place where public transport is not able to reach .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting , especially for a long distance .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .
As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .
Recently , several studies have shown evidence that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering from diseases and saving lives .
Second , public transport saves city spaces .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded .
Correspondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
Provided that every citizen owns a car and uses it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congestion .
Last but not least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to their surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relaxation .
People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot outside .
Though there are many advantages to public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one mode of transport can replace others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one .
Languages for the future
Should we learn other languages ?
We live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome them .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the one hand , it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the world without the language barrier .
Also , in recent years , learning to express yourself in English , French , Germany and Russian has become something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Also , I consider that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitable in the future , but to achieve it , they will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .

129,"Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport . It is an individual sport , so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness . It is a sport that can be learnt at any age , but children can start to learn swimming as early as two years of age .
Swimming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful for weight reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight . It is also the best sport for asthmatic patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you want to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of people of your age ."

Today , I went to Winnie 's home with Adriana in the afternoon .
We ate delicious food and played interesting games altogether .
We had a great time .
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon , we arrived at Winnie 's home .
First , we listened to some songs , such as almost and big big world .
After thirty minutes , we had tea .
Winnie loves eating very much , so I can easily find much food at her home .
We had mouth - watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy .
After having tea , we played hide - and - seek altogether in Winnie 's garden .
Adriana and I hid behind a bench and Winnie looked for us .
Suddenly , Winnie fell over a little stone .
Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
Your knee is bleeding .
Are you okay ' I asked .
I was shaking like a leaf and my heart was pounding since I was worried about Winnie .
I had butterflies in my stomach . ' Yes , I am fine , ' Winnie replied .
I felt relieved then .
Then , Adriana found a plaster and put it on Winnie 's wound .
Winnie felt warm inside and smiled happily .
I felt glad today , although Winnie hurt herself .
Why ?
It is because our friendship is more rugged .
What an unfoggetable day !
In my opinion , the house in the future will be better .
The house of the future will be big and bright .
The inside will be full of conveniences .
Big spaces will be divided into a few zones .
Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen 's zones and so on .
In the house of the future , there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in every house .
Television will be cordless , in this way as at present .
Every house will be flexible .
Thanks to that , it can expand or reduce ."
131,"See you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Regarding advertisement , technology has a huge , and not always possitive impact on outdoor advertising .
From black - and - white adds posted in public places , we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor additions placed in every available and imaginable spot .
From buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs .
Recent developments in mobile technology allow advertisers to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
I ' m sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca on my computer or mobile at home , on my way to work , the add on the buses I will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of Mallorca , or an add from Tripadvisor with Mallorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it will even be useful , but I ' m also sure sometimes I will find it aggresive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
The way it feels aggresive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
Advertisement might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed in the wrong spot or shown at the wrong time they loose their artistic side .
But technology is not for the best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in the suburbs of Artem or Vladivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independently .
If I had this house , I would decorate it in modern style .
I would build a fitness gym , wardrobe - room , swimming pool .
If I had such a house , I would like to equip a barbecue area in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relativists .
Together we could spend time in a pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Though I am a beginner of it , I think it 's interesting , since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel stressed , I always play tennis to release my pressure .
If you are a beginner of tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
As the proverb goes , if you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right tools first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skill step by step .
Since tennis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn these important skills slowly and steadily , you may get hurt during the practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is also critical ."
130,"Hello Paul ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antaya on October .
I had a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert .
I got a lot of experience from them .
In the concert time , all people can enjoy themselves , but nobody thinks about how they are preparing for the concert .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparation time .
For example , they know everything about each helper 's jobs , but at the same time they just concern their own subjects .
I want to explain to you some interesting part of my experience .
In the concert morning we were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided to not think about the concert , just do your job which would be given .
When we were arranging the concert plan , we made work sharing for all of us .
Some of them started designing the stage , some of them checking the songs volume and lights .
My job was checking the songs list which singers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers .
They always wanted to change some songs which were on the list .
At the concert time , I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
Actually , everybody can be worried because they gave time and effort for it .
Finally the concert started and all the lights were shining like stars .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the concert finished , I felt like a bird which was flying freely .
Of course , I had some pain in my legs because , all the time , I was standing .
However , I like to volunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invite you to our next concert which will be next month . If you have any time , please come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am waiting for your email ."
133,"You just click on it .
They have to reduce their budget .
Despite changing channels , we see the same news .
Big Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to keep journalists and cameras all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy them ."
132,"A skilled coach can teach you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices on the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
That was only 30 years ago .
An explosion of channels arrived in our houses in the eighties .
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
The number of channels is gradually decreasing .
In our country , one decade ago , when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All TV tried to get several licences to distribute their shows .
In order to resolve some deficits , today there are mainly two TV groups .
Less channels mean less choices .
Internet TV is increasing .
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who is watching this or that TV program .
You just follow a suggestion made by someone ."
134,"Summary
TV is dying .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit ."
135,"However , the fact is that there is a countdown on them ."
136,"Dear Mrs Hopkins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your small group on a trip around the world .
I am a 20 - year - old student from Switzerland speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
With several trips to many countries I have made until now , I would say that I have already gained some experience travelling around the world .
I am interested in joining your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For ten years , I have been in a scout group in which I have learned a lot about different kinds of things to find a way or to orient myself in the wilderness .
Furthermore , I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Steve ,"
137,"It was good to hear from you .
Basically , my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible . I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of your country as well .
As I told you before , I ca n't afford to pay this trip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me .
But I want to find a job to help him with the bills .
Can you give me a hand on it ?
You can also help me to find a cheap place to rent .
It will be helpful if you find a small apartment near Cambridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
Thanks for all your help and I look forward to hearing from you ."

Hi John ,"
140,"Best wishes ,"
139,"I am looking forward to seeing you .
First of all , you should get outside of the airport terminal .
There you will see bus stations in the street .
When you get there , take the bus which has number 111 .
Then ride to the bus stop "" Zličín "" .
There you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
If you choose this way , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where we will meet exactly .
But if I were you , I would take a taxi . The underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
Anyway , you need to get to the centre . I 'll wait for you there .
Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time of year .
That 's why you do n't have to take warm clothes .
I am delighted to see you soon ."
142,"The middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on goods .
So , I believe either we will have public transport or people will be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
Nowadays , people have different views about reading books and watching movies .
Some of them think that books are more interesting than film versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a well - educated person and gives a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
Furthermore , books develop imagination of the reader .
When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
You can imagine how heroes look like , you can imagine different views of where the action takes place .
And finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in a company , the best way for you is movies .
Because you can watch them with your friends .
Also , many people choose movies because they like soundtracks and special effects .
It 's so exciting .
But all these factors are not important for me .
I suppose that books are better than the film version .
To sum up , I 'd like to say reading is a really great thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum .
She was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl noticed a cute doll in a shop .
She had blond hair and she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... '' Mum I love this doll ! Could you bye it for me ? '' she said .
Her mum could n't deny it to her , so she bought it .
Oh!The girl had so many special moments with her doll ! They looked so adorable together ! They were like twins !
After some years , the girl decided that she had to move .
She was eighteen years old . She had to be indepedent .
So she took a deep breath and put her doll in the attic just like her childhood memories .
At night she heard some creepy noises from there ...
She went there and there was the doll with a knife in her hand . '' Bell , why do n't you play with me anymore ? Are you boring of me ? Just because I have only one eye ? But you removed the other one .
Just because I do n't have one if my gloves are on , but you did it again!''she screamed ."
143,"And then ...
Next day , going to her home , her mum wanted to find her daughter .
So , she went upstairs ...
The girl had a knife in her neck and on the wall there was a sentence , '' Why did you leave me that way ? ''
Tennis is an individual sport .
Just you have to deal with the game .
You can choose lots of places to play .
You need a good pair of shoes , a tennis racket and some balls and a person who plays with you .
Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can lose finally .
This sport is not just about physical power .
You are supposed to use your brain as well .
It is combination of physical power , a technique and a mental power .
As with other sports , tennis is becoming more modern , fast and commercial .
I mean professional tennis .
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Some of them practise tennis because of their parents .
It is not fair enough .
Children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps with physical health and so on .
You can start if you are grown up anyway ."
144,"It is never too late .
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .

147,"Essay
In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .
Is it really worth leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?
It is true that going abroad can open new points of view about your own learning process .
Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are doing .
Besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plan it properly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured of reaching your goals at all , so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focused on your learning tasks .
From my point of view , I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages , especially if you have some money saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need ."
148,"You can even talk with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms online , such as Skipe and others .
Football is a passion
When I was little , I tried a lot of sports , handball , Swimming , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of those . It is a sport that I have never imagined : football .
All my life , I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I tried it , I loved it .
Have you ever thought about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football , I did it with my classmates , who were all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable . However , some years ago , they started to intergrate me when they play , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .
Now , some women and I have started to organize female matches , so I am more used to playing with girls . I never imagined that I would be so keen on football , but now it takes part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .
One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to reacive some punches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center ."
149,"I have been there twice , and I like it .
Its name is "" The English oven "" , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
The restaurant has a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They also have a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The desserts are very good too .
They ' ve got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional ones .
There is a big variety of ice creams .
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually go there .
During the whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accompanying them .
In my view , a public person deserves to have their own life , without photographing .
On one hand , becoming a public person associates with jornalist , mass - media , flashes .
Famous people are obligated to provide their lives in an exemplary way .
However , they are still ordinary people , they make mistakes .
People are thought of as jealous .
Notice any kind of failures .
It seems to me that a journalist might be absolutely toxic and they have defective infulence on society which assesses celebrites through the prism of a journalistic documentary .
On the other hand , many stars sell their privacy to earn more and more money .
The value of their talent , abilities are counted in the amonut of tabloids scandals .
Summing up , all over the world , there are famous people who do n't bring into the limelight their lives .
It has been very useful for a long time . Nevertheless , nowadays , there are some people who ask if public transport should be suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the cost , because people who do not have a car need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
The cars need to be repaired . Besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
In addition , these people need public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted ."
150,"If you use public transport , you can be less polluted than before because there are a lot of people who travel together on only one mode of transport .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides , in some cities , a car can not be parked in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
Summing up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car .
From my point of view , I get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country .
We are living in an ever changing world .
Today 's new things become things of the past in a few months .
Take an example of mobile technology . Your latest handset with latest configurations becomes outdated within a few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people 's lives will definitely change in such a long period .
However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or a negative one .
In the last 50 years , science and technology took great leaps . The internet , mobiles made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information at our fingertips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost in a new place . Google maps are always there to help .
We need not to cram English words in today , as we can quickly find the meaning of any word on our mobiles .
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do n't need to face anyone . Everything can be managed through virtual platforms .
Today , our lives have become much more comfortable than in the past , thanks to progress mankind has made in technology .
On the other hand , a number of terrorism , global warming and greed have become top challenges of today 's world .
Climate changes due to global warming cause natural disasters now and then .
Terrorist activities causing havoc in public life .
Corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people leaders .
If these challenges are not addressed in the coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool . In the right hand it would be boon for us , in the wrong hands it has power to destroy the world as we see it today .
To those who may concern ,"
