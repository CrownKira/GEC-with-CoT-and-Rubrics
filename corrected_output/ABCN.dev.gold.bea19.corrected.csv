My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played every place . When I travel on the beach , I like playing with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I like playing with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I ' m writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country is available .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Madrid you can visit "" Puerta del Sol "" , "" Las Cibeles "" .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad ."
1,"It 's difficult to answer the question "" what are you going to do in the future ? "" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . At that moment , you realized the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Car , Train & Flight .
Depending on the distance and duration of the desired place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by National Highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels for food and just in case any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since , we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah ."
5,"Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in the mass transport system .
Also , people need not to suffer high operating costs running their own car .
But they can use a cheaper way to get to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
In my opinion , public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport will continue to have a future , but people are going to use more cars than buses or underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them because we are waiting for the bus or underground , but in another way , the car costs more money than public transport .
By car , we can just stay with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned , but if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with public transport .
If I had to choose between both transportation , I think I would probably choose the car , because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building , we have special trashcans to separate the garbage from organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles , and they also made talks and presentations about earth problems , like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us all over the years a recognised ecological community .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share what is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football . Why do I choose it ? Well , football is an international sport . People around the world will love it so much ! Example like the Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .
I believe that 's all about us ."
