It is very funny . when I was young I like plays with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball . Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I ' m writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country . On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of place to travel . For example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
