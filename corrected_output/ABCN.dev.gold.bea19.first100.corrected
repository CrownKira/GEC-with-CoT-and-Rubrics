It 's difficult to answer the question ' what are you going to do in the future ? ' if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman , and even a butcher ... I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider it more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when travelling by public transport .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something or want to be friends and exchange telephone numbers .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and back home .
In my opinion , a car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street ; in that moment , you realize the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , like cycles , bikes , cars , trains , and flights .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to , and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train and flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children and enjoy looking after them ; also , I have organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family thinks that my cooking is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you .
Thanks .
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere ; when I travel on the beach , I like playing with my sister in the sand and after we go to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I liked playing with the ball in the playground , and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network for volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country , there are a lot of places to travel .
For example : Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit , for example , in Madrid you can visit " Puerta del Sol " , " Las Cibeles " .
I visited Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are few jobs because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want , I will look for a job for you .
My best friend is looking for someone responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you would need to look after her every weekend .
Would you be interested in this job ?
Thank you for your email ; it was wonderful to hear from you .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will continue to do so in the future .
This is because public transport is a cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transport systems .
Also , people need not suffer high operating costs running their own cars .
But it can provide a cheaper way of getting to their destinations , especially if they are far away from home .
For example , I think it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane to travel to another country .
Instead , it will be more common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
In my opinion , I think that public transport in the future will continue to be used because there are a lot of people who do not have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used . So , public transport will continue to have a future , but people will use more cars than buses or underground .
If we think about it , a car is better because we do not need to wait for it , as we do for the bus or underground . However , cars cost more money than public transport .
By car , we can stay with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music we like and do not need to be around people who are unknown . But if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family . So , both transportations have their advantages and cars do not necessarily have to end up replacing public transport .
If I had to choose between both transportations , I think I would probably choose a car because it is better for me to travel by car than by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in environmental and ecological issues .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building , we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles . We also make talks and presentations about the earth 's problems , such as global warming and contamination .
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us a recognized ecological community over the years .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share with you my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football because it is an international sport , and people around the world love it so much ! For example , the Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup , and so on .
I believe that will delight us all .
By the way , my favourite football team is Manchester United ; they are brilliant ; they have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream : to be a superhero !
After many years , he still dreamt of becoming a superhero .
He entered the university of medicine because he thought that this profession was the most similar to being a superhero .
Passing some years of university , he met a girl called Kate , and he fell in love with her , and she fell in love with him .
Kate was cursing the university of fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day when Michael told her his dream to be a superhero . Kate got so nervous , saying that it was ridiculous and just a child 's dream , and that Michael was only dreaming , but that would never happen , and that superheroes do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad , saying that she was lying and did n't have a heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
The following day , she said sorry , and they were happy again .
But when they got to Michael 's home , they fought again , and Michael grabbed a knife and killed her .
He cried with a lot of blood around .
Michael ran away from there .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history ; it brings numerous benefits to our lives .
For instance , we take the subway to avoid traffic jams .
It is true that travelling by car is more convenient than taking public transportation , but it causes more damage to our lives and harms our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offspring .
Giving them a safe , clean , and comfortable place to live .
Without public transportation , traffic jams would be worse than before .
In my city , Taipei , we always get stuck in traffic for about an hour in the morning .
I ca n't imagine how long it would take me to get to school without buses or the MRT .
Cars are convenient for humans , but they also bring damage to humans .
For example , carbon dioxide , which is created by cars .
It causes global warming , which threatens our environment and harms our daily lives .
We can see that there have been many serious and frequent weather disasters in recent decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wildfires , and mudslides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , they immediately start looking for it .
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process is started right away .
