3,"By the way , my favourite football team is Manchester United ; they are brilliant . They have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream : to be a superhero !
After many years , he still dreams of becoming a superhero .
He entered the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession is the most similar to being a superhero .
Pass some years of university and he met a girl called Kate , and he fell in love with her , and she fell in love with him .
Kate was studying at the university of fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate were very happy , until one day when Michael told her his dream to be a superhero . Kate got so nervous , saying that it was ridiculous and just a child 's dream . She said that Michael was only dreaming , but that would never happen and that superheroes do not exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and got mad , saying that she was lying and did not have a heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to leave his apartment .
The following day , she said sorry , and they were happy again .
But when they got to Michael 's home , they fought again , and Michael grabbed a knife and killed her .
He cried with a lot of blood around .
Michael ran away from there .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings many benefits to our lives .
For instance , we take the subway to avoid being stuck in traffic .
It is true that travelling by car is more convenient than taking public transportation . However , it would cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future and our offsprings .
Giving them a safe , clean , and comfortable place to live .
If there were no public transportation , traffic jams would be worse than before .
In my city , Taipei , we are stuck in traffic for about an hour in the morning .
I ca n't imagine if there were no buses or MRTs . How long would it take me to get to school ?
Cars are convenient for humans , but they also bring damage to humans .
For example , carbon dioxide , which is created by cars .
It causes global warming , which threatens our environment and harms our daily lives .
We can see that there have been many serious and frequent weather disasters in recent decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wildfires , and mudslides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped .
If the film does not arrive on time , it is immediately followed up .
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process is started right away
The pleasure of travelling
People come , people go .
Every day , many people are travelling abroad . But , what is the best way to travel internationally ?
The most important option for travel is , by far , the plane ."
1,"It 's difficult to answer the question ' what are you going to do in the future ? ' if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman , and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when traveling by public transport .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something and exchange contact information .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and back home .
In my opinion , a car is not necessary when you have crashed in the street . In that moment , you realize the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , like cycles , bikes , cars , trains , and flights .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , traveling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to , and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by National highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when traveling by train and flights ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that traveling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .

In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family thinks that my cooking is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you .
Thanks
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere . When I travel on the beach , I like playing with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I liked playing with the ball in the playground , and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
