2,"There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit , for example , in Madrid you can visit "" Puerta del Sol "" , "" Las Cibeles "" .
I visited Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are few jobs because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want , I will look for a job for you .
My best friend is looking for someone responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after her every weekend .
Would you be interested in this job ?
Thank you for your email ; it was wonderful to hear from you .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will continue to do so in the future .
This is because public transport is a cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transport systems .
Also , people need not suffer high operating costs running their own cars .
But it can provide a cheaper way of getting to their destinations , especially if they are far away from home .
For example , I think it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for travelling to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
In my opinion , I think that public transport in the future will continue to be used because there are a lot of people who do not have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used . So , public transport will continue to have a future , but people will use more cars than buses or underground systems .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do not need to wait for them as we do for buses or underground trains . However , cars cost more money than public transport .
By car , we can just stay with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music we like and do not need to be around people who are unknown . But if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family . So , both transportations have their advantages and cars do not necessarily have to end up replacing public transport .
If I had to choose between both transportations , I think I would probably choose a car because it is better for me to travel by car than by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in environmental and ecological issues .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building , we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles . We also make talks and presentations about the earth 's problems , such as global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us a recognized ecological community over the years .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share with you my favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football , and I chose it because football is an international sport , and people all over the world love it ! For example , the Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup , etc .
I believe that will delight us all ."
