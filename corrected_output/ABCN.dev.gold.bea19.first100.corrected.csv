Every day , lots of people travel abroad , but what 's the best way to travel internationally ?
By far , the most important option for travel is the plane ."

My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere . When I travel to the beach , I like playing with my sister in the sand , and afterwards , we go to the sea .
It is a lot of fun .
When I was young , I liked playing with the ball in the playground , and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a volleyball net .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to give you some advice on traveling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country , there are a lot of places to travel .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , and Valencia .
These are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Madrid , you can visit "" Puerta del Sol "" and "" Las Cibeles "" .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
Every summer , I visit Sevilla because I love this city , and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country , there are few jobs because the economy is very bad ."
4,"By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant , have amazing football players , and are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream : to be a superhero !
After many years , he still dreams of becoming a superhero .
He entered the university of medicine because he thought that this profession was the most similar to being a superhero .
After some years at the university , he met a girl named Kate , and they fell in love with each other .
Kate was studying at the university of fashion .
Then the two started dating .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day when Michael said his dream was to be a superhero . Kate got so nervous , saying that it was ridiculous , just a childish dream , and that superheroes do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and got mad , saying that she was lying and did n't have a heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to leave his apartment .
The following day , she apologized and they were happy again .
But when they got home , they fought again , and Michael grabbed a knife and killed her .
He cried with a lot of blood around .
Michael got away from there ."
5,"Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings a multitude of benefits to our lives .
For instance , we take the subway to avoid getting stuck in traffic .
It is true that traveling by car is more convenient than taking public transportation . However , it causes more damage to our lives and harms our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future and our offspring .
Giving them a safe , clean , and comfortable place to live .
If there were no public transportation , traffic jams would be more serious than before .
In my country , Taipei , we always get stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine how long it would take for me to get to school if there were no bus or MRT .
Cars are convenient for humans , but they also bring damage to humans .
For example , carbon dioxide which is created by cars .
It causes global warming which threatens our environment and harms our daily life .
We can see that there have been lots of serious and frequent weather disasters happening in decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wildfires , and mudslides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it is immediately .
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process is started right away .
The pleasure of traveling ."
3,"But if you want me to look for a job for you .
My best friend is looking for someone responsible to look after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old , and you should look after her every weekend .
Are you interested in this job ?
Thank you for your e - mail . It was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and will continue to do so in the future .
Because public transport is cost - effective and provides better resource allocation in the mass transport system .
Also , people do not need to suffer high operating costs when running their own car .
But it can be a cheaper way to go to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for traveling to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and fly on a public plane .
In my opinion , I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people who do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used . So , public transport will continue to have a future , but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them as we do when waiting for the bus or the underground , but on the other hand , cars cost more money than public transport .
By car , we can just be with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around unknown people . But if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both transportation options are good , and the cars do n't necessarily need to compete with public transport .
If I had to choose between both transportation options , I think I would probably choose the car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological matters .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the back garden , with worms that eat and break down all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building , we have special trash cans to separate the garbage into organic waste , paper and cardboard , cans , and pet bottles . We also have talks and presentations about environmental issues like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all these projects is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us a recognized ecological community over the years .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share about my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football . Why do I choose it ? Well , football is an international sport that people around the world love so much ! For example , the Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup , and so on .
I believe that 's all will delight us ."
1,"It 's difficult to answer the question "" What are you going to do in the future ? "" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman , and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider it more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when traveling by other means .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to be friends and exchange telephone numbers .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to take the bus to go to school and back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you are stuck in traffic ; at that moment , you realize the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , like cycles , bikes , cars , trains , and flights .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , traveling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently taken to the place Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels to have food , and just in case any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to stop anytime we want when we travel by car ( which is impossible when traveling by train and flight ) .
In addition , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that traveling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family thinks that my cooking is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you ."
