1,"It 's difficult to answer the question ' what are you going to do in the future ? ' if the only one who has to know it is in two minds . 
 When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman , and even a butcher . I do n't know why . 
 I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people . 
 It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier . 
 Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not . 
 I think that public transport will always be around in the future . 
 The rich people will buy cars , but the poor people always need to use buses or taxis . 
 I consider it more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when traveling by public transport . 
 Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to become friends and exchange telephone numbers . 
 In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and back to my house . 
 In my opinion , a car is not necessary when you have crashed in the street . In that moment , you realize the importance of public transport . 
 In India , we have various types of public transport , like cycles , bikes , cars , trains , and flights . 
 Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly . 
 But generally speaking , traveling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport . 
 This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to , and the place is Agra . 
 It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra . 
 We stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we purchased some snacks just before the trip . 
 Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when traveling by train and flight ) . 
 In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh . 
 Due to the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that traveling by car is much more convenient . 
 My name is Sarah . 
 I am 17 years old . 
 I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps . 
 I love children and enjoy looking after them . Also , I have organized many sports activities before in my school . 
 In addition to that , I enjoy cooking . My family thinks that my cook is amazing . 
 I hope that you give me the chance to join you . 
 Thanks . 
 My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends . 
 Volleyball is a sport played everywhere , when I travel on the beach , I like playing with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea . 
 It is very funny . 
 When I was young , I liked playing with the ball in the playground , and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball . 
 Dear Jo , 
 How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that some advice on traveling and working in my country . 
 On the one hand , in my country , there are a lot of places to travel . 
 For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia ."
2,"There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit ; for example , in Madrid , you can visit "" Puerta del Sol "" , "" Las Cibeles "" . 
 I visited Madrid twice a year . 
 All summer , I visit Sevilla because I love this city , and I suggest that you visit Sevilla . 
 On the other hand , in my country , there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad . 
 But , if you want , I will look for a job for you . 
 My best friend is looking for someone responsible for looking after her sister . 
 Her sister is 6 years old , and you should look after her every weekend . 
 Would you be interested in this job ? 
 Thank you for your email ; it was wonderful to hear from you . 
 I am looking forward to seeing you . 
 Take care , Laura . 
 Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and will continue to do so in the future . 
 This is because public transport is a cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transport systems . 
 Also , people need not suffer high operating costs running their own cars . 
 Instead , they can use a cheaper way to get to their destinations , especially if they are far away from home . 
 For example , I think it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane to travel to another country . 
 Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane . 
 In my opinion , I think that public transport in the future will continue to be used because there are a lot of people who do not have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used ; therefore , public transport will continue to have a future , but people will use more cars than buses or underground . 
 If we think about it , the car is better because we do not need to wait for it , as we wait for the bus or underground . 
 However , cars cost more money than public transport . 
 By car , we can stay with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music we like and do not need to be around people who are unknown . 
 But , if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family ; therefore , both transportations are good , and cars do not necessarily have to end up replacing public transport . 
 If I had to choose between both transportations , I think I would probably choose a car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus . 
 In my community , we are very interested in environmental and ecological things . 
 We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school . 
 In some strategic points of the building , we have special trash cans to separate the garbage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles , and they also make talks and presentations about the earth 's problems , like global warming , contamination , etc . 
 The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher . 
 All these initiatives have made us a recognized ecological community over the years . 
 Good morning everyone , today I want to share about my favorite sport . 
 My favorite sport is football , and I chose it because football is an international sport , and people around the world love it so much ! For example , the Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup , and so on . 
 I believe that all will delight us ."
3,"By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United ; they are brilliant . They have amazing football players , and they are awesome . 
 Michael was a little kid when he had a dream : to be a superhero ! 
 After many years , he still dreamed of becoming a superhero . 
 He entered the university of medicine because he thought that this profession was the most similar to being a superhero . 
 Passing some years of university , he met a girl called Kate , and he fell in love with her , and she fell in love with him . 
 Kate was cursing the university of fashion . 
 Then the two started to date . 
 Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day when Michael told her his dream to be a superhero . Kate got so nervous , saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid 's dream . She told Michael that he was only dreaming , but that would never happen , and that superheroes do n't exist . 
 When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad , saying that she was lying and did n't have a heart . 
 He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment . 
 The following day , she said sorry , and they were happy again . 
 But when they got to Michael 's home , they fought again , and Michael grabbed a knife and killed her . 
 He cried with a lot of blood around . 
 Michael ran away from there . 
 Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake . 
 Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings numerous benefits to our lives . 
 For instance , we take the subway to avoid traffic jams . 
 It is true that traveling by car is more convenient than using public transportation . However , it causes more damage to our lives and harms our environment . 
 Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offspring . 
 Giving them a safe , clean , and comfortable place to live . 
 If there were no public transportation , traffic jams would be worse than before . 
 In my city , Taipei , we are stuck in traffic for about an hour in the morning . 
 I ca n't imagine if there were no buses or MRT , how long it would take me to get to school . 
 Cars are convenient for humans , but they also bring damage to humans . 
 For example , carbon dioxide , which is created by cars , causes global warming , threatening our environment and harming our daily lives . 
 We can see that there have been many serious and frequent weather disasters in recent decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wildfires , and mudslides . 
 What other precautions are usually taken ? 
 The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped . 
 If the film does not arrive on time , they immediately start looking for it .

 Every day , many people travel abroad , but what is the best way to do international travel ? 
 The most important option for travel is , by far , the plane ."
