2,"There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit - for example , in Madrid , you can visit ' Puerta del Sol ' and ' Las Cibeles ' .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
All summer , I visit Sevilla because I love this city , and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country , there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want , I will look for a job for you .
My best friend is looking for someone responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old , and you should look after her every weekend .
Will you be interested in this job ?
Thank you for your email - it was wonderful to hear from you .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and will continue to do so in the future .
This is because public transport is a cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transport systems .
Also , people need not suffer high operating costs running their own cars .
But , they can use a cheaper way of getting to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
In my opinion , I think that public transport in the future will continue to be used because there are a lot of people who do not have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used ; so , public transport will continue to have a future , but people will use more private cars than buses or underground trains .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do not need to wait for it , as we do for the bus or underground , but in another way , cars cost more money than public transport .
By car , we can stay with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like , and we do not need to be around people who are unknown ; but if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family ; so , both transportations are good , and cars do not necessarily have to end up replacing public transport .
If I had to choose between both transportations , I think I would probably choose a car because it is better for me to travel by car than to travel by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building , we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles , and they also made talks and presentations about the earth 's problems , like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us a recognized ecological community .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share about my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , and I chose it because it is an international sport that people around the world love so much ! Examples include the Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup , and so on .
I believe that will delight us all ."
1,"It is difficult to answer the question ' what are you going to do in the future ? ' if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman , and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It is difficult because I will have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you will study it easier .
Maybe I will change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than traveling by public transport .
Also , you will meet friendly people who usually ask you something and exchange contact information .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and back home .
In my opinion , a car is not necessary when you have crashed in the street . In that moment , you realize the importance of public transport .
In India , we have various types of public transport , like cycles , bikes , cars , trains , and flights .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , traveling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to , and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by National highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when traveling by train and flights ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that traveling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children and enjoy looking after them . Also , I have organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family thinks that my cooking is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you .
Thanks
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love to play with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere . When I travel on the beach , I like to play with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I liked to play with the ball in the playground , and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
