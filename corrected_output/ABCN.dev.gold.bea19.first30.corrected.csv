1,"It 's difficult to answer the question "" what are you going to do in the future ? "" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you carry more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . In that moment you realized the importance of public transport .
In India we have various types of public transport , like cycle , bike , car , train & flight .
Depending on the distance and duration of the desired place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently visited and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by National Highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels for food and , just in case any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .","It 's difficult to answer the question ""What are you going to do in the future?"" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds.
